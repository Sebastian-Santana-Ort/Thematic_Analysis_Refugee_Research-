OBJECTIVE: To examine the diagnostic prevalence of conduct,  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and mood/anxiety disorders in  immigrant, refugee, and nonimmigrant children and youth in British Columbia,  Canada. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective, population-level  cohort study examined linked health administrative records of children and youth  in British Columbia (birth to age 19 years) spanning 2 decades (1996-2016).  Physician billings, hospitalizations, and drug dispensations were linked to  immigration records to estimate time-in-British Columbia-adjusted prevalence of  mental disorder diagnosis among children and youth from immigrant or refugee  backgrounds compared with those from nonimmigrant backgrounds. Analyses were  conducted from August 2020 to November 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The  diagnostic prevalence of conduct, ADHD, and mood/anxiety disorders were the main  outcomes. Results were stratified by migration category (immigrant, refugee,  nonimmigrant), generation status (first- and second-generation), age, and sex.  RESULTS: A total of 470 464 children and youth in British Columbia were included  in the study (227 217 [48.3%] female). Nonimmigrant children and youth  represented 65.5% of the total study population (307 902 individuals). Among  those who migrated, 142 011 (87.8%) were first- or second-generation immigrants,  and 19 686 (12.2%) were first- or second-generation refugees. Diagnostic  prevalence of mental disorders varied by migration category, generation status,  age, and sex. Children and youth from immigrant and refugee backgrounds (both  first- and second-generation), compared with nonimmigrant youth, generally had a  lower prevalence of conduct disorder (eg, age 6-12 years: first-generation  immigrant, 2.72% [95% CI, 2.56%-2.90%] vs nonimmigrant, 7.03% [95% CI,  6.93%-7.13%]), ADHD (eg, age 6-12 years: first-generation immigrant, 4.30% [95%  CI, 4.10%-4.51%] vs nonimmigrant, 9.20% [95% CI, 9.08%-9.31%]), and mood/anxiety  disorders (eg, age 13-19 years: first-generation immigrant, 11.07% [95% CI,  10.80%-11.36%] vs nonimmigrant, 24.54% [95% CI, 24.34%-24.76%]). Among immigrant  children and youth, second-generation children and youth generally showed higher  prevalence of conduct, ADHD, and mood/anxiety disorders than first-generation  children and youth (eg, ADHD among second-generation immigrants aged 6-12 years,  5.94% [95% CI, 5.75%-6.14%]; among first-generation immigrants aged 6-12 years,  4.30% [95% CI, 4.10%-4.51%]). Second-generation refugee children had the highest  diagnostic prevalence estimates for mood/anxiety in the 3-to-5-year age range  relative to first- and second-generation immigrant and nonimmigrant children (eg,  second-generation refugee, 2.58% [95% CI, 2.27%-2.94%] vs second-generation  immigrant, 1.78% [95% CI, 1.67%-1.89%]). Mental disorder diagnoses also varied by  age and sex within immigrant, refugee, and nonimmigrant groups. CONCLUSIONS AND  RELEVANCE: These findings show differences in diagnostic mental disorder  prevalence among first- and second-generation immigrant and refugee children and  youth relative to nonimmigrant children and youth.

Refugees face vulnerabilities that may contribute to injury risk. We aimed  to compare the rates of unintentional injuries in immigrant children and youth by  visa class and region of origin. METHODS: Population-based, cross-sectional study  of children and youth (0-24 years) from immigrant families residing in Ontario,  Canada, from 2011 to 2012. Multiple linked health and administrative databases  were used to describe unintentional injuries by immigration visa class and region  of origin. Poisson regression models estimated rate ratios for injuries. RESULTS:  There were 6596.0 and 8122.3 emergency department visits per 100 000 non-refugee  and refugee immigrants, respectively. Hospitalisation rates were 144.9 and 185.2  per 100 000 in each of these groups. The unintentional injury rate among refugees  was 20% higher than among non-refugees (adjusted rate ratio (ARR) 1.20, 95% CI  1.16, 1.24). In both groups, rates were lowest among East and South Asians. Young  age, male sex, and high income were associated with injury risk. Compared with  non-refugees, refugees had higher rates of injury across most causes, including  for motor vehicle injuries (ARR 1.51, 95% CI 1.40, 1.62), poisoning (ARR 1.40,  95% CI 1.26, 1.56) and suffocation (ARR 1.39, 95% CI 1.04, 1.84). INTERPRETATION:  The observed 20% higher rate of unintentional injuries among refugees compared  with non-refugees highlights an important opportunity for targeting  population-based public health and safety interventions. Engaging refugee  families shortly after arrival in active efforts for injury prevention may reduce  social vulnerabilities and cultural risk factors for injury in this population.",Oct-18,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,Y,"Unintentional injury.

Much research pertaining to  refugee children's well-being focuses on psychiatric symptoms. Relatively few  studies have examined how social context factors-such as perceptions of peer  belonging, and support from adults at home and at school-contribute to the  emotional health of refugee children. Informed by social-ecological theories  emphasizing dynamic interactions between the contexts in which children develop,  we examined associations between social context factors and emotional health in  refugee children. METHODS: Data were drawn from a population-based data linkage  in British Columbia, Canada. The analytic sample included 682 grade 4 students  (M(age) 9.2 years; 46.3% female) with a refugee background who responded to the  Middle Years Development Instrument (MDI) during the 2010/2011-2016/2017 school  years. The MDI is a self-report survey of children's social and emotional  competencies and social context factors completed at school. Regression analyses  were used to examine associations of social context factors (school climate,  supportive adults at school and at home, and peer belonging) with indicators of  emotional health (life satisfaction, self-concept, optimism, and sadness).  Refugee generation status (first/second) was considered through stratification  and testing of interactions with social context factors. RESULTS: Perceived  supportive school climate, support from adults in school and at home, and peer  belonging were each independently associated with better emotional health.  Results were similar for first- and second-generation children. CONCLUSION: Taken  together, results suggest a unique role of the school context to refugee  children's emotional health.

Refugee children typically face the challenge of  starting or continuing their educational carrier in a completely new context and  in a completely new language. In this study, we examine the role of preschool  attendance and formal language instruction in supporting young refugee children  to acquire destination language competencies. We pursue three research  objectives: First, we aim at identifying relevant conditions associated with  German language acquisition in general. Second, we examine the (relative)  importance of institutional learning support in preschool and language  instruction. Third, we investigate whether the benefits of attending preschool  are more pronounced for refugee children who have only limited exposure to the  destination language outside of the institutional context, as compared to  children who have more exposure to the language outside of preschool. Using data  from the ReGES study, we analyze the early processes of destination language  acquisition among a large population of refugee children of preschool age in  Germany. Our findings indicate that conditions associated with motivation,  exposure and efficiency of learning that were found in prior research to  determine destination language competencies of children from other immigrant  groups apply to refugee children in a similar manner. Additional conditions  associated with the specific circumstances that refugees often experience,  including possible consequences of insecure residence status, risk of  post-traumatic stress disorders, and living in collective accommodation, do not  significantly contribute to this outcome in our analysis. Furthermore, we find  that there is a positive relationship between children's German language  competency levels and both preschool attendance and formal language instruction.  The findings indicate that the benefits of attending preschool are largely  related to additional language instruction that refugee children receive within  this context. Moreover, these benefits are particularly pronounced among refugee  children who have only limited exposure to German at home and in their everyday  lives.

METHOD: Phenomenological and discourse analysis was applied to  attachment narratives of nine children (aged 11-17 years) and their surviving  mothers in families that lost fathers in war-related circumstances. The  narratives were analysed through the lens of Crittenden's Dynamic-Maturational  Model of Attachment and Adaptation (DMM) and Klass' cross-cultural model of  grief. RESULTS: Two divergent pathways - 'burying the past' and 'reifying the  past' - emerged, encompassing the children's contrasting patterns of information  processing regarding loss and trauma (dismissing or preoccupying) and  representation of the past (distant-buried or rich-reconstructed). Each pathway  reflected a strategic compromise between the constraints and resources presented  to the child by the circumstances of the loss (ambiguous or confirmed), the  response of their surviving parent (stricken or stoic) and the collective  narrative surrounding the loss (silenced or valorised). CONCLUSION: The DMM's  conceptualisation of attachment as self-protective strategies for navigating  danger was helpful in explaining the contrasting adaptations of refugee children  to loss and trauma. However, to understand the multivalent meanings of these  adaptations, there was a need to situate child-parent attachment relationships  within the wider sociocultural reconfigurations arising from contexts of  political violence.",Apr-18,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,N,"Tamil refugees, qualitative analysis of attachment narratives","Sample based, qualitative",NA,,294-310,,2,23,,Clin Child Psychol Psychiatry,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 29260574,,,,"*Bereavement; *Object Attachment; *Parent-Child Relations; Adolescent; attachment narrative; Child; DMM; Fathers/*psychology; Female; Humans; India; Male; Models, Psychological; parental death; psychological adaptation; psychological trauma; Refugee children and adolescents; Refugees/*psychology",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to the social inequalities  contributing to early childhood dental caries, the effectiveness of dental care  service for immigrant children should be evaluated. AIM: To evaluate the  accessibility of immigrant and refugee children residing in four different  regions of Turkey to oral health products and dental treatment services. DESIGN:  A questionnaire consisting of 21 questions was administered: The first six  questions elicited demographic data, and the remaining 15 questions asked about  oral health habits, access to oral hygiene materials, and dental treatment  services. Participants included the parents of 430 children under the age of 18,  who were registered with migrant associations in the regions where they lived  (Istanbul, Samsun, Hatay, or Ankara). RESULTS: The majority of the participants  were from Syria and Iraq. Of the participants, 42.1% reported that their  children's oral hygiene habits had changed negatively after they migrated, 71.9%  reported that they had not been to the dentist in the last year, and 82.8%  reported that they had not been to the dentist for more than 12 months. Access to  oral and dental hygiene products was not difficult for 68.4%. About 62.6%,  however, reported that they had difficulty accessing dental treatment.

The United Nations  Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) is the most ratified human rights  treaty in history, with 196 States Parties (SPs). The CRC provides a framework of  54 articles outlining government responsibilities to ensure the protection,  promotion, and fulfillment of rights of all children within their jurisdictions.  Among these are the rights of refugee and asylum-seeking children, declared under  Article 22 of the CRC. Refugee and asylum-seeking children, similarly to all  other children, are entitled to their rights under the CRC and do not forgo any  right by virtue of moving between borders. The hosting governments, as SPs to the  CRC, are the primary duty bearers to fulfill these rights for the children  entering their country. This manuscript provides an overview of the health and  developmental ramification of being displaced for refugee and asylum-seeking  children.

More than half of these (>10 million) are children, representing a highly vulnerable population. Most children  experience high levels of trauma exposure, including war trauma, as well as  substantial migration- and resettlement-related stress. These exposures confer  risk for mental health problems, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD),  but their relative contributions have not been fully explicated. These effects  may be modulated by the developmental timing of trauma and stress exposure:  childhood trauma and stress are broadly linked to worse health outcomes across  the lifespan, but the developmental specificity of these effects remains  uncertain. Refugee children typically experience the trauma leading up to  displacement (e.g., civil war) which often lasts for decades, and for some,  followed by resettlement. Longitudinal studies that follow children through this  process can provide unique insight into how these experiences of trauma,  displacement, and resettlement during development impact mechanisms of risk and  resilience. They can also elucidate how environmental and physiological factors  may modulate the effects of trauma and stress. The present study includes two  groups of families (parents and their 7- to 17-year-old children): (1) Syrian and  Iraqi refugee families who experienced war-zone trauma before resettling in the  United States in ~2016, and (2) Arab immigrant families who did not experience  war-zone trauma prior to resettlement in the United States in ~2016. We assessed  symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD in refugee and immigrant children and  parents. Skin conductance responses, a measure of autonomic response, saliva  samples for genetic and epigenetic analyses, and information about social and  environmental context, including family structure, resources, and neighborhood  quality, were also collected. Refugee participants provided data at three time  points spanning ~3 years following resettlement in the United States: Wave 1,  within 1 month of resettlement, Wave 2, 12-24 months post resettlement, and Wave  3 planned for 24-36 months resettlement. Immigrant participants will provide data  once, within 3-5 years after immigration, matching the age of Wave 1. This  comparison group enables us to compare mental health and biomarkers between  refugees and immigrants. Results of these comparative analyses will provide  insight into the impact of war trauma versus other types of trauma and adversity  on biomarkers of child mental health outcomes. Results from the longitudinal  analyses will address refugee mental health trajectories over time, and, in  children, across development. Initial data from Wave 1 showed high levels of  anxiety in refugee children, as well as high levels of PTSD symptoms and anxiety  in their parents. Together, results from these comparative and longitudinal  analyses will provide insight into multiple aspects of trauma and stress exposure  in refugees and immigrants, including how the developmental timing of trauma  exposure impacts biomarkers and mental health across development.

OBJECTIVE: To test whether neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage is associated  with risk of psychiatric disorders among refugee children and adolescents and  examine whether the association differs by sex, age at arrival, and family  structure. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This quasi-experimental  register-based cohort study included refugees in Denmark aged 0 to 16 years at  the time of resettlement from 1986 to 1998. A refugee dispersal policy  implemented during those years assigned housing to refugee families in  neighborhoods with varying degrees of socioeconomic disadvantage in a  quasi-random (ie, arbitrary) manner conditional on refugee characteristics  observed by placement officers. Cox proportional hazard models were used to  examine the association between neighborhood disadvantage and risk of psychiatric  disorders, adjusting for relevant baseline covariates. EXPOSURES: A neighborhood  disadvantage index combining information on levels of income, education,  unemployment, and welfare assistance in the refugees' initial quasi-randomly  assigned neighborhood. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: First-time inpatient or  outpatient diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder before age 30 years. RESULTS:  Median (IQR) baseline age in the sample of 18 709 refugee children and  adolescents was 7.9 (4.7-11.7) years; 8781 participants (46.9%) were female and  9928 (53.1%) were male. During a median (IQR) follow-up period of 16.1  (10.2-20.8) years, 1448 refugees (7.7%) were diagnosed with a psychiatric  disorder (incidence rate, 51.2 per 10 000 person-years). An increase of 1 SD in  neighborhood disadvantage was associated with an 11% increase in the hazard of a  psychiatric disorders (hazard ratio [HR], 1.11; 95% CI, 1.03-1.21). This  association did not differ between male and female individuals, refugees who  arrived at different ages, or those from single- vs dual-parent households. In  secondary analyses using prescribed psychiatric medication as the outcome, a  similar association with neighborhood disadvantage was found (HR, 1.08; 95% CI,  1.03-1.14). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, neighborhood  disadvantage was associated with an increase in risk of psychiatric disorders.  The results suggest that placement of refugee families in advantaged  neighborhoods and efforts to enhance the neighborhood context in disadvantaged  areas may improve mental health among refugee children and adolescents.",2022-11-01,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,Y,mental health and neighborhood,cohort study,NA,,1107-1114,,11,176,,JAMA Pediatr,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 36094528  PMCID: PMC9468942,,,,*Mental Disorders/epidemiology; *Refugees/psychology; Adolescent; Child; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Residence Characteristics; Vulnerable Populations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the creation of the Refugee  Resettlement Program in 1980, refugee families have settled in the US more than  in any other country in the world [3]. In 2018, for the first time, Canada  overtook the US in numbers of refugees accepted [1]. Foreign-born people now  account for 13.7% of the total US population [1]. Further, a quarter of children  in the United States currently live in households with at least one foreign-born  parent [4]. These population shifts are important to note because immigrant and  refugee families bring cultural influences and health experiences from their home  countries which can greatly affect the overall health and well-being of children.  For these new arrivals, oral health is often a significant health issue. The  severity of dental disease varies with country of origin as well as cultural  beliefs that can hinder access to care even once it is available to them [5,6].

It is based on a sample of 184 children and adolescents aged 11-18  years old, residing at two refugee centers in the Republic of Serbia. Out of 184  participants, the majority was male (N = 155; 84.29%). More than a half of  participants (53.3%) displayed significant symptoms of PTSD. 50% consume energy  drinks, 28% use tobacco; 13% use alcohol; 4.6% use marijuana; 1.7% use LSD,  amphetamines, glue, tranquilizers and cocaine. Female respondents were more  frequently expressing emotional difficulties (p < 0.05) while male participants  were more frequent users of alcohol or substances (p < 0.01). Younger children  were more frequently expressing symptoms of hyperactivity and prosocial behavior,  while they were less frequently using substances. There is also a significant  negative correlation between the years of education and individual proneness to  substance use. Furthermore, those who resided in a greater number of refugee  camps were found to experience greater levels of emotional and behavioral  difficulties and face a greater risk of physical abuse. The burden of migration  increases proneness to substance use, as a consequence of scarce coping resources  and the stress of adjusting. Migrants are vulnerable to substance use, since some  of them have commonly witnessed and/or personally experienced pre-and  post-migration stress and trauma, including loss of homes and livelihoods,  violence, torture and family separation.

Ambivalence involves tensions between protection of refugee children and  protection of national borders, public services and entrenched images. Unresolved  ambivalence supports failures to honor the rights of refugee children according  to international law and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. There is  failure to protect and include them in national public services and in  international coordination of public health and wellbeing. We identify  misrepresentations of childhood and refugeeness that lie behind ambivalence and  the equitable organization and delivery of public services for health and  wellbeing. With illustrative studies, we propose a developmental relational  framework for understanding refugee children's contributions in the sociocultural  environment. Contrary to the image of passive victims, refugee children interact  with other people and institutions in the co-construction of situated encounters.  A developmental relational understanding of children's 'co-actions' in the social  environment provides a foundation for addressing misrepresentations of childhood  and refugeeness that deny refugee children protection and inclusion as  rights-bearers.

Complex and inclusive social identities are mechanisms that can  explain the link between structural school cultural diversity (i.e., proportion  of students of immigrant descent and the number of different ethnic groups) and  positive intergroup relations. We expected that similar mechanisms might be at  play linking cultural diversity approaches in schools with adolescents'  intergroup relations. AIM: We examined the link between two sub-dimensions of  cultural diversity approaches (i.e., equal treatment; heritage and intercultural  learning) and adolescents' prosocial intentions and behaviour towards refugee  youth. Then, we explored the mediating role of identity inclusiveness (i.e.,  perceived similarity of the self with others). SAMPLE AND METHODS: We sampled  culturally diverse eighth grade adolescents from 54 classrooms in Berlin  (N = 503, M(age)  = 13.76 years, 50.6% female). Surveys measured perceived  cultural diversity norms, adolescents' perceived identity inclusiveness with  refugee youth, prosocial intentions to support refugee youth, and willingness to  donate to a project for refugee youth. RESULTS: Multilevel models revealed that  adolescents' perception of heritage and intercultural learning predicted  adolescents' prosocial intentions towards refugee youth, but not their  willingness to donate. Equal treatment was not a significant predictor of  adolescents' prosocial intentions towards refugee youth, or their willingness to  donate. Identity inclusiveness did not mediate the relation between cultural  diversity approaches and prosocial intentions. However, identity inclusiveness  did positively relate adolescents' prosocial intentions and willingness to  donate. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that culturally diverse schools that engage in  heritage and intercultural learning might help to promote positive relations  between local and refugee youth in schools and society.

This paper describes the demographic and clinical profiles  of recently resettled Syrian and Iraqi refugee children and adolescents across  physical, psychosocial, developmental and educational domains using standardised  multidisciplinary assessments. DESIGN: A cross-sectional observational study was  undertaken of initial specialist paediatric multidisciplinary Refugee Health  Service assessments completed at the tertiary paediatric hospital (Western  Australia) between June 2015 and September 2019. RESULTS: Three hundred and  twenty-seven children and adolescents (264 Syrian, 63 Iraqi) were assessed  following resettlement. Witnessed trauma (86%) and disclosed adversity (median  Refugee Adverse Childhood Experiences score 3, range 1-14) were universally high.  Almost all patients had health issues identified across physical (99%),  psychosocial (76%) and developmental/educational (75%) domains.

However, it is still unclear (1) whether maltreatment is actually linked  to youth's long- and short-term memory deficits and (2) whether potential  impairments are due to maltreatment per se or related psychopathology. OBJECTIVE:  Based on the Attentional Control Theory, we investigated a mediational model in  which maltreatment would be related to psychopathology (internalizing symptoms,  posttraumatic stress symptoms, posttraumatic cognitions), which would in turn be  related to impaired memory functioning. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: We drew on a  sample of 155 Burundian refugee youth (aged 11 to 15) currently living in refugee  camps in Tanzania and at high risk of experiencing ongoing maltreatment by  parents. METHODS: Youth reported on their experiences of maltreatment and  psychopathology in structured clinical interviews and completed visuospatial  memory tasks involving a short-term and a working memory component (Corsi Block  Tapping Test) and delayed recall from long-term memory (Rey-Osterrieth Complex  Figure). RESULTS: Structural equation modeling showed that psychopathology  mediated the association between increased maltreatment and reduced working  memory capacity (β = -0.07, p = .02), with a trend towards mediation for  short-term memory (β = -0.05, p = .06). Higher levels of maltreatment, but not  psychopathology, were directly linked to long-term memory deficits (β = -0.20,  p = .02).

STUDY DESIGN: We compared overseas and US interferon-γ release assay  (IGRA)/tuberculin skin test (TST) results and LTBI diagnosis; assessed  postarrival LTBI treatment initiation and completion; and evaluated the impact of  switching from TST to IGRA to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection  overseas. RESULTS: In total, 73 014 children were diagnosed with LTBI overseas  and arrived in the US during 2007-2019. In the US, 45 939 (62.9%) completed, and  1985 (2.7%) initiated but did not complete a postarrival evaluation. Among these  47 924 children, 30 360 (63.4%) were retested for M tuberculosis infection. For  17 996 children with a positive overseas TST, 73.8% were negative when retested  by IGRA. For 1051 children with a positive overseas IGRA, 58.0% were negative  when retested by IGRA. Overall, among children who completed a postarrival  evaluation, 18 544 (40.4%) were evaluated as having no evidence of TB infection,  and 25 919 (56.4%) had their overseas LTBI diagnosis confirmed. Among the latter,  17 229 (66.5%) initiated and 9185 (35.4%) completed LTBI treatment. CONCLUSIONS:  Requiring IGRA testing overseas could more effectively identify children who will  benefit from LTBI treatment. However, IGRA reversions may occur, highlighting the  need for individualized assessment for risk of infection, progression, and poor  outcome when making diagnostic and treatment decisions.

We examined the perceived environmental barriers and  facilitators of refugee children's PA. METHODS: Perceptions of PA environments by  refugee children (n = 15, 6 to 13 years old) and their parents (n = 10) were  captured by questionnaires and drawing workshops from one refugee accommodation  in Berlin. Besides, photovoice was conducted with three children to obtain an  in-depth understanding of their experiences of existing environments for PA.  Research was applied between June and July 2019. All research material was  transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Refugee children and  their parents identified micro-environments as the centre of children's daily PA,  they usually played indoors but most parents perceived there was no spaces. In  meso environments, children and parents thought there were insufficient spaces  and were worried about neighbourhood safety. Furthermore, parents concerned more  about 'space accessibility' for their children's playing purposes instead of  'space quality (e.g., equipment)' . Children also indicated the importance of  informal spaces for their PA. CONCLUSIONS: Refugee children perceive a lack of  space and safety when attempting to play in the existing micro and meso  environments. Related practitioners should focus on providing more play spaces in  micro environments and safe access to existing neighbourhood playfields.

With limited education and  skills, children become vulnerable socioeconomically, thereby exposing themselves  to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) risks. METHODS: Against this background,  the authors undertook a scoping review of the existing literature between January  and June 2019 to highlight current knowledge on SRH of African migrant and  refugee children. Twenty-two studies that met the inclusion criteria were  reviewed. RESULTS: The results identified overcrowding and sexual exploitation of  children within refugee camps where reproductive health services are often  limited and underutilized. They also reveal language barriers as key obstacles  towards young migrants' access to SRH information and services because local  languages used to deliver these services are alien to the migrants. Further,  cultural practices like genital cutting, which survived migration could have  serious reproductive health implications for young migrants. A major gap  identified is about SRH risk factors of unaccompanied migrant minors, which have  received limited study, and calls for more quantitative and qualitative SRH  studies on unaccompanied child migrants. Studies should also focus on the  different dimensions of SRH challenges among child migrants differentiated by  gender, documented or undocumented, within or across national borders, and within  or outside refugee camps to properly inform and situate policies, keeping in mind  the economic motive and spatial displacement of children as major considerations.  CONCLUSION: The conditions that necessitate economic-driven migration of children  will continue to exist in sub-Saharan Africa. This will provide fertile grounds  for child migration to continue to thrive, with diverse sexual and reproductive  health risks among the child migrants. There is need for further quantitative and  qualitative research on child migrants' sexual and reproductive health  experiences paying special attention to their differentiation by gender,  documented or undocumented, within or across national borders and within or  outside refugee camps.",2021-04-17,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,M,Sexual and reproductive health,Review,NA,,81,,1,18,,Reprod Health,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 33865417  PMCID: PMC8052768,,,,"*Refugees; *Transients and Migrants; Adolescent; Adolescent Health; Africa; African migrant; Child; Child Health; Child migration; Circumcision, Female; Female; Humans; Prevalence; Refugee children; Reproductive health; Reproductive Health/*ethnology; Sexual Behavior; Sexual health; Sexual Health/*ethnology",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although there are clear benefits of Social-Emotional  Learning curricula, which can help children achieve long-term success emotionally  and academically, Social-Emotional Learning curricula are not easily accessible  for refugee children, often because of language and socioeconomic barriers.

To (1) determine the prevalence of elevated blood lead levels (EBLLs; ≥ 5 µg/dL) among newly arrived refugee children, (2) understand the demographic  characteristics of refugee children with EBLLs, and (3) assess health care  providers' compliance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  recommendations for retesting. Methods. We matched refugee demographic data  (2015-2019) from the CDC's Electronic Disease Notification (EDN) system with  lead-testing laboratory report data from the Pennsylvania National Electronic  Disease Surveillance System using Match*Pro software. Results. Of 3833 refugee  children 16 years or younger in the EDN system, matching identified 3142 children  with blood lead level data.

In the United Kingdom, the number of refugee  children is increasing; however, little is known about their psycho-social and  physical well-being. AIM: This study aims to investigate the psychological  well-being and behaviour of refugee children compared to British-born children on  a number of psychological, social, behavioural, and health-related issues and to  investigate the role of friendship as a protective factor. SAMPLES: This study  utilized a sample of 149 refugee children recruited from two charities, 79 of  which are children aged 6-10 years and 70 older refugee children aged  11-16 years. The study also included 120 non-refugee children recruited from  primary schools aged 6-10 years. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study that  investigates the psycho-social well-being of refugee children compared to  non-refugee British-born children. The study explored symptoms of posttraumatic  stress disorder, emotional and behavioural problems (Strengths and Difficulties  Questionnaire), self-esteem, friendships and popularity, bullying and  victimization, physical health, and psychosomatic problems. RESULTS: Young  refugee children reported more peer problems, functional impairment, physical  health, and psychosomatic problems compared to the control children and older  refugee children groups. On the other hand, older refugee children had lower  self-esteem (academic and social self-peers) compared to the younger refugee  children group. The differences between the groups were explained by friendship  quality, number of friends, peer bullying/victimization, or sibling  bullying/victimization except for physical health and psychosomatic problems.  CONCLUSIONS: While refugee children were found to be at risk on various levels,  the findings also point to the fact that social relationships including  friendship quality and number of friends played an essential protective role.  Conversely, bullying was a risk factor that explained many of the refugees'  problems.

In  Europe, about one-third of all refugees are children, an increasing number of  which are travelling alone. There are often no systematic medical health  assessments for these refugee children on entry in reception countries despite  the fact that they are recognised as an at-risk population due to increased  burden of physical and mental health conditions. We aimed to perform a systematic  review of the literature to describe the health status of refugee children on  entering reception countries. METHODS: A systematic search of published  literature was conducted using the terms refugee, immigrant or migrant, medical  or health, and screening. RESULTS: Of the 3487 potentially relevant papers, 53  population-based studies were included in this review. This systematic review  showed that refugee children exhibit high estimated prevalence rates for anaemia  (14%), haemoglobinopathies (4%), chronic hepatitis B (3%), latent tuberculosis  infection (11%) and vitamin D deficiency (45%) on entry in reception countries.  Approximately one-third of refugee children had intestinal infection. Nutritional  problems ranged from wasting and stunting to obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Refugee  children entering reception countries should receive comprehensive health  assessments based on the outcomes of this systematic review, national budgets,  cost-effectiveness and personal factors of the refugees. The health assessment  should be tailored to individual child health needs depending on preflight,  flight and postarrival conditions.A paradigm shift that places focus on child  health and development will help this vulnerable group of children integrate into  their new environments.

Turkey is the  country hosting the largest number of refugees in the world with 3.6 million  Syrian refugees 46 % of which are under 18 years old. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of  this article is to conduct a narrative review and analyze the vulnerabilities of  refugee children in Turkey from the lens of the Sustainable Development Goals  (SDG), more specifically SDG Goal 3: Good Health and Wellbeing, with a specific  focus on Syrian refugee children. Moreover, this article explores the actions  taken to prevent and mitigate issues that arise from these vulnerabilities.  METHOD: This narrative review article collected data from various primary and  secondary sources on the Turkish refugee framework including national and  international legislation, governmental and non-governmental data and reports,  and scientific papers. RESULTS: Syrian refugee children in Turkey are facing a  variety of risks in terms of their health and wellbeing including communicable  and non-communicable diseases, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, family  violence, child labor, and child marriage. The measures taken for prevention and  response by governmental and non-governmental entities are multilateral and aim  to address issues from multiple perspectives including medical, psychosocial,  child protection, and legal. CONCLUSIONS: The interventions and restructuring of  the health system in Turkey contribute to the SDG number 3 for refugee children.  The existence of a legal system which enables refugee access to health,  protection, and other social services is key to achieve this goal. However, the  existing system could be improved especially through solidifying the legal basis  and centralizing the implementation for child and refugee protection.

Alone or with family members, child refugees are exposed to multiple  and potentially traumatic events, including conflict and human rights deprivation  in their country of origin, perilous and life-threatening escape journeys, years  of statelessness, and isolation and discrimination in their new host country.  AIMS: This phenomenological study explored the positive and negative  interpretations of four adults as they sought to make sense of their experiences  of refugee status as children. METHOD: Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis  (IPA) guided the development of semi-structured interview for data collection and  analysis. RESULTS: One superordinate theme, Violation and Hope, overarched three  subordinate themes, Violent detachment, Refugee identity, and Resourcefulness and  reciprocity. One divergent theme also emerged: Clashing identities. These themes  provide unique insight into the interpreted experiences of escaping oppression  and persecution in each participant's country of origin as children, and the  ensuing bleak interval as refugees, belonging nowhere. They identify the risk of  becoming pawns of opportunism without human rights protection. Once stateless,  survival was not guaranteed, producing a stark merging of acceptance of mortality  and determined resourcefulness as children. Avoidant coping became a positive  tool for surviving ever present threat, and was crucial in defining a life  philosophy that was future oriented as they entered adulthood.

The Healthy Immigrant Children study  employed a mixed-methods cross-sectional study design to characterize the health  and nutritional status of 300 immigrant and refugee children aged 3-13 years who  had been in Canada for less than 5 years. Quantitative data regarding  socioeconomic status, food security, physical activity, diet, and bone and body  composition and anthropometric measurements were collected.

Sixty percent of refugees and 42% of  immigrants had high blood cholesterol. Significant health concerns for refugee  children include stunting and high blood cholesterol levels, and emerging trends  indicate that older immigrant children from privileged backgrounds in low-income  countries may be more at risk of overweight and obesity.

However, little is known about either levels or predictors of  refugee children's literacy or about their attitudes toward reading in low- or  middle-income countries. To address this, we conducted in-home literacy  assessments using the Holistic Assessment of Learning and Development Outcomes  with 322 Syrian refugee mother-child dyads who lived in Jordan (child age range  4-8 years, M = 6.32 years, 50% female). Overall, the children had quite low  levels of literacy, although they indicated a strong enthusiasm for reading.  Child age, maternal education, and maternal ability to read all predicted child  literacy, although maternal literacy predicted it only among children enrolled in  school. Among those enrolled in school (64.9% of the total sample, 88.7% of those  aged ≥ 6), students attending hybrid classes had better literacy than those  attending either solely in-person or solely online, although the frequency of  school attendance did not predict literacy. A less consistent pattern emerged for  predicting children's attitudes toward reading.

Many of them struggle with mental  reactions to traumatic events experienced pre-migration, and to the daily hassles  they face after being granted asylum and residence. Despite continuous high  levels of mental health problems URY demonstrate remarkable agency and social  mobility in the years after being granted asylum in their destination countries.  A sense of subjective well-being (SWB) may enable resilient outcomes in people  exposed to past or ongoing adversities. To fill the gap in the research  literature about positive psychological outcomes among URY, the overall aim of  this study was to explore the longitudinal associations between SWB and two  taxing acculturation hassles: perceived discrimination and ethnic identity  crisis. Three annual waves of self-report questionnaire data were collected from  a population-based sample of URY; n = 581, M (age) = 20.01(SD = 2.40), M (length  of stay) = 4.63 (SD = 4.40), 82 % male, mainly from Afghanistan, Somalia, Iraq,  and Sri Lanka. The longitudinal associations between SWB, perceived  discrimination and ethnic identity crisis across time were analyzed using  auto-regressive cross-lagged modeling. The results revealed that perceived  discrimination, but not ethnic identity crisis, negatively predicted subsequent  levels of SWB. More importantly, high levels of SWB at one timepoint predicted  decreases in both discrimination and ethnic identity crisis at subsequent  timepoints. Further, increases in SWB from one timepoint to the next was  associated with significant co-occurring decreases in both discrimination and  ethnic identity crisis, and vice versa. Despite the negative effect of perceived  discrimination on SWB, promoting SWB in URY can protect them from future hazards  of acculturation hassles in complex ways. We underscore the need for more  research on SWB among URY and other refugee youth. We further discuss the  potential of SWB to foster resilient outcomes in young refugees and suggest that  interventions to strengthen SWB among them should consider their transnational  and multicultural realities and experiences.",2022,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,920657,,,13,,Front Psychol,,,,,,,,eng,"Copyright © 2022 Oppedal, Keles and Røysamb.",,,,,,Place: Switzerland PMID: 36092076  PMCID: PMC9453845,,,,discrimination; ethnic identity; life satisfaction; longitudinal; subjective well-being; unaccompanied refugee minors; youth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper discusses the  rationale for and protocol of a mixed methods investigation focusing on improving  education and employment outcomes among refugee background youth aged 15 to 24  years from three focus regions: the Middle East (Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Syria),  South Asia (Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar/Burma, Pakistan) and Africa (Sudan, South  Sudan, Liberia, Ethiopia, Somalia, DR Congo). OBJECTIVE: The rationale of the  project is to identify the facilitators and barriers to successful transition  from school to further education and employment; investigate participant  awareness of support systems available when faced with education and employment  difficulties; redress the disadvantages encountered by refugee background youth;  and bridge the gap between research, policy, and practice in relation to social  inclusion and participation. METHODS: The study involves collecting survey data  from 600 youth followed by individual interviews with a subset of 60 youth, their  parents/primary caregivers, and their teachers. A cross-sectional survey will  assess facilitators and barriers to successful transition from school to further  education and employment. Individual interviews will provide context-rich data on  key issues relevant to education and employment outcomes. RESULTS: The study  began in 2016 and is due for completion by the end of 2019. The quantitative  survey has been conducted with 635 participants and was closed in March 2019. The  qualitative interview stage is ongoing, and the current total in April 2019 is 93  participants including educators, youth, and family members of the youth.  Analysis and presentation of results will be available in 2020. Some preliminary  findings will be available during the late half of 2019. CONCLUSIONS: This  project will contribute new and unique insights to knowledge in relation to key  factors influencing education and employment outcomes among refugee youth. This  research will enable effective planning for the needs of some of Australia's most  disadvantaged and marginalized young people, leading to a sustainable improvement  in the education and employability of young refugees.

METHODS: We  completed a scoping review of the published literature. We included articles  published in English with a focus on the health of sub-Saharan African refugee  children living outside Africa.

The most vulnerable are children who face separation from parents,  interruption of schooling and child labour. This study explores the living and  working conditions of Syrian children in Lebanon. METHODS: In this  cross-sectional study, we randomly selected 153 informal tented settlements and  conducted interviewer-administered surveys among Syrian refugee working children  in the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon. Those aged 8-18 completed a questionnaire on  sociodemographic and occupational characteristics; those aged 4-8 years were  surveyed through a household questionnaire. RESULTS: We surveyed 1902 households,  including 12 708 individuals and 4377 working children. Female-headed households  were poorer and more food-insecure than male-headed households. Among working  children (4-18 years), the average age of starting work was 10.9 years and 74.8%  worked in agriculture. Compared with boys, girls earned less and were less likely  to be enrolled in school. For 96.3% of working children aged 8-18 years, forced  exodus to Lebanon was associated with a first child labour experience. Working  conditions were harsh and worse for girls who compared to boys were less likely  to receive their salary on time and take time off work. Girls worked longer in  the sun and cold and were more likely to report having a health symptom at work,  working under pressure and using sharp or heavy objects at work. Seventy-nine  children reported knowing another child who died following a work accident.  CONCLUSION: Children, as young as 4, are forced to work, and many are compelled  to forgo educational opportunities in favour of harsh and harmful labour due to  difficult economic conditions.

In refugee contexts, schools are generally perceived as protective  environments where children can build a sense of belonging and recover from  trauma. Evidence shows that positive school climates can support student skills  development and socio-emotional wellbeing and protect them against a host of  adverse outcomes. However, schools are also places where children may experience  violence, from both teachers and peers. Prevalence estimates of violence against  children in humanitarian settings are scarce and evidence on the relationship  between school climate and student outcomes in these contexts is non-existent.  The aim of the study is to estimate the prevalence of school-based violence  against children and to explore the association between perceptions of school  climate and students' experiences and use of violence and their depression  symptoms. We relied on data from a cross-sectional survey of students and  teachers in all primary and secondary schools in Nyarugusu Refugee Camp in  Tanzania, conducted as part of a cluster randomised controlled trial, to compute  prevalence estimates and used mixed logistic regression analysis to assess the  association between school climate and students' outcomes. We found that students  in Nyarugusu experienced high levels of violence from both peers and teachers in  both primary and secondary schools in the camp, with little difference between  boys and girls. Nearly one in ten students screened positive for symptoms of  depression. We found that opportunities for students and teachers to be involved  in decision-making were associated with higher odds of violent discipline and  teachers' self-efficacy was a significant protective factor against student  depression symptoms. However, generally, school-level perceptions of school  climate were not associated with student outcomes after adjusting for potential  confounders. Our findings suggest that interventions to prevent and respond to  teacher and peer violence in schools and to support students' mental health are  urgently needed. Our results challenge the assumption that education environments  are inherently protective for children and call for further investigation of  norms around violence among students and teachers to better understand the role  of school climate in refugee settings.",2022-07-23,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,42,,1,16,,Confl Health,,,,,,,,eng,© 2022.

Refugee and  non-refugee children utilized less mental health care than their Swedish peers,  apart from the youngest refugees (0-10 years) who had similar utilization as  Swedish-born.

Mainstreaming is considered a best practice but may  not always be feasible given the limited resources available in refugee camps.  The purpose of this study is to examine the extent to which school setting (i.e.,  special needs vs. mainstream classrooms) is associated with changes in children's  prosocial behaviors (i.e., social skills and ability to get along well with  peers) and behavioral difficulties, accounting for disability status. In Kakuma  Refugee Camp in Kenya, researchers collected two waves of data (approximately  2.5 years apart) for students enrolled in special needs schools (n = 78) and  students who had transitioned from special needs schools into mainstream  classrooms (n = 51). Children's average prosocial scores decreased between wave 1  and wave 2, but scores from children in special needs schools decreased at a  lower rate indicating potential protective factors in these settings. While  children's average total difficulties decreased over time, children's  difficulties in special needs schools decreased at a faster rate, also indicating  potential protective factors. Neither severity of disability nor gender  significantly predicted change in prosocial or difficulties scores. In the  context of a refugee camp, mainstreaming alone may not fully address the needs of  children with disabilities. Specific factors seen in special education settings,  such as individualized services, accessible accommodations, and infrastructure  supports, must be considered as a means of creating inclusive educational  environments.",2022-10-13,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,53,,1,16,,Confl Health,,,,,,,,eng,© 2022.

Children and adolescents with migration and refugee backgrounds are subject to various health-related, psychosocial,  sociocultural, and economic burdens that may influence the prevalence,  manifestation, course, and treatment as well as prognosis of mental disorders. In  addition, they are particularly disadvantaged by numerous barriers to accessing  the mental healthcare and treatment granted natives. The so-called transition gap  only exacerbates the situation. As a solution, we provide recommendations for  improving the mental healthcare of children and adolescents with a migration and  refugee background analogous to the situation for adults.

The United  Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reports that refugee and  resettlement experiences can influence the critical stages of intellectual,  social, emotional and physical development of children. There is a lack of  sufficient information about the prevalence of developmental delay in forcibly  displaced children. In this study, we aimed to describe the impact of the Syrian  crisis on the development of children after resettlement, factors that are  associated with developmental problems and domains in which developmental delays  are more likely to occur. METHODS: Refugee children (n=60) between the ages of  18-72 months admitted to the Yenimahalle Community Health Center Immigrant Health  Unit to receive primary health care services between 1 November 2018- 1 March  2019 were included in this study. The control group included 60 Turkish children  between 18-72 months admitted to the İsmail Ulucan Family Health Center which is  in the same building. Developmental assessments were conducted by the researchers  using the Denver II Developmental Screening Test (DDST-II). Sociodemographic  characteristics of the child, family and caregivers as well as risk factors  related to development were collected using a questionnaire. The interviews with  refugee families were conducted with an interpreter. RESULTS: Developmental delay  was more frequent in refugee children compared to Turkish children. The DDST-II  were normal in 82.1%, questionable in 10.7% and abnormal in 7.1% of Turkish  children; in the study group, 22.2% of the patients were found to be normal,  33.3% were questionable and 44.4% were abnormal. The differences were  statistically significant (p < 0.05). Multiple logistic regression analysis  revealed that, being a forcibly displaced refugee was the single significant risk  factor for developmental delay alone. In the DDST II subdomain analysis, it was  seen that high monthly income reduces the risk of caution-delay in  personal-social domain. It was found that birth weight below 2500 g increased the  risk of caution-delay in the fine-motor and gross-motor domain and being a  forcibly displaced refugee and consanguinity increased the risk of caution -delay  in the language domain. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that being a forcibly  displaced refugee was the most important risk factor for developmental delay. We  emphasized the importance of surveillance and screening development in these  highrisk children as well as early intervention services.",2022,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,683-693,,4,64,,Turk J Pediatr,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: Turkey PMID: 36082642,,,,"*Refugees/psychology; child; Child; child development; Child, Preschool; Consanguinity; developmental delay; forced displacement; Humans; Infant; Mass Screening; refugee; Risk Factors; Syria; war",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forcibly  displaced children and youth have often been exposed to stressful life events and  are therefore at increased risk of developing mental health issues. Hence, early  screening and assessment for mental health problems is of great importance, as is  research addressing this topic. However, there is a lack of evidence regarding  the reliability and validity of mental health assessment tools for this  population. Objective: The aim of the present study was to synthesise the  existing evidence on psychometric properties of patient reported outcome measures  [PROMs] for assessing the mental health of asylum-seeking, refugee and internally  displaced children and youth. Method: Systematic searches of the literature were  conducted in four electronic databases: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase and Web of  Science. The methodological quality of the studies was examined using the COSMIN  Risk of Bias checklist. Furthermore, the COSMIN criteria for good measurement  properties were used to evaluate the quality of the outcome measures. Results:  The search yielded 4842 articles, of which 27 met eligibility criteria. The  reliability, internal consistency, structural validity, hypotheses testing and  criterion validity of 28 PROMs were evaluated. Conclusion: Based on the results  with regard to validity and reliability, as well as feasibility, we recommend the  use of several instruments to measure emotional and behavioural problems, PTSD  symptoms, anxiety and depression in forcibly displaced children and youth.  However, despite a call for more research on the psychometric properties of  mental health assessment tools for forcibly displaced children and youth, there  is still a lack of studies conducted on this topic. More research is needed in  order to establish cross-cultural validity of mental health assessment tools and  to provide optimal cut-off scores for this population. HIGHLIGHTS Research on the  psychometric properties of mental health screening and assessment tools for  forcibly displaced children and youth is slowly increasing.However, based on the  current evidence on the validity and reliability of screening and assessment  tools for forcibly displaced children, we are not able to recommend a core set of  instruments.

Uganda hosts 1.3 million refugees, of which 60% are aged under 18. There are  knowledge gaps regarding HIV testing facilitators and barriers, including HIV and  intersecting stigmas, among urban refugee youth. In response, we explored  experiences and perspectives towards HIV testing strategies, including HIV  self-testing, with urban refugee youth in Kampala, Uganda. METHODS: We  implemented a qualitative study with refugee cisgender youth aged 16 to 24 living  in Kampala's informal settlements from February-April 2019. We conducted five  focus groups with refugee youth, including two with adolescent boys and young  men, two with adolescent girls and young women and one with female sex workers.  We also conducted five key informant (KI) interviews with government,  non-government and community refugee agencies and HIV service providers. We  conducted thematic analyses to understand HIV testing experiences, perspectives  and recommendations. RESULTS: Participants (n = 49) included young men (n = 17)  and young women (n = 27) originally from the Democratic Republic of Congo [DRC]  (n = 29), Rwanda (n = 11), Burundi (n = 3) and Sudan (n = 1), in addition to five  KI (gender: n = 3 women, n = 2 men; country of origin: n = 2 Rwanda, n = 2  Uganda, n = 1 DRC). Participant narratives revealed stigma drivers included fear  of HIV infection; misinformation that HIV is a ""Ugandan disease""; and blame and  shame for sexual activity. Stigma facilitators included legal precarity regarding  sex work, same-sex practices and immigration status, alongside healthcare  mistreatment and confidentiality concerns. Stigma experiences were attributed to  the social devaluation of intersecting identities (sex work, youth, refugees,  sexual minorities, people living with HIV, women). Participants expressed high  interest in HIV self-testing. They recommended HIV self-testing implementation  strategies to be peer supported and expressed concerns regarding sexual- and  gender-based violence with partner testing. CONCLUSIONS: Intersecting stigma  rooted in fear, misinformation, blame and shame, legal precarity and healthcare  mistreatment constrain current HIV testing strategies with urban refugee youth.  Findings align with the Health Stigma and Discrimination Framework that  conceptualizes stigma drivers and facilitators that devalue intersecting health  conditions and social identities. Findings can inform multi-level strategies to  foster enabling HIV testing environments with urban refugee youth, including  tackling intersecting stigma and leveraging refugee youth peer support.",Mar-21,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,e25674,,3,24,,J Int AIDS Soc,,,,,,,,eng,© 2021 The Authors.

Many URMs have experienced the cumulative stress of being exposed  both to the adverse environmental conditions which drive forced migration, and to  the traumatic experience of displacement and resettlement. These experiences,  coupled with other developmental stressors, may impede their overall development  and increase their likelihood of mental health problems. Despite the evident  vulnerability of URMs, much controversy currently surrounds the legitimacy of  their arrival in host countries and their mental health is given little  consideration. OBJECTIVE: This review synthesises and examines the limited  published literature on the impact of traumatic refugee experiences on the mental  health and development of URMs. METHODS: Academic databases and other sources  were searched using key terms relating to URMs and mental health. RESULTS: The  findings confirm in large part that being a URM negatively influences mental  health development, and that adolescence and being female are particular  indicators of increased risk of psychiatric disorders. However, cultural  differences in measurement and assessment of mental health are important  confounding factors. CONCLUSIONS: The current literature on youth in transit  consistently paints a picture of how experiences URMs face can place a great  burden on their mental health - clearly depicting an urgent need to consider  their mental health within the current climate. The pressing need for improved  care based on best practice is discussed.",Dec-19,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,104146,,,98,,Child Abuse Negl,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In Rwanda,  the situation for refugees in Mahama Refugee Camp has worsened, as COVID-19  lockdown measures have increased needs while restricting access to basic  services. Few assessments have been conducted on the SRH needs of refugees in  Mahama camp, including adolescents and youth, since COVID-19. To address this  gap, Save the Children (SC) undertook research utilizing SenseMaker to collect  data on the SRH needs of adolescents and youth in Mahama camp, as well as in the  surrounding host community. METHODOLOGY: SC used SenseMaker to collect 745 data  entries from adolescents and youth in Mahama camp and the surrounding host  community. The application was pretested with adolescents and youth in Mahama  camp before initiating the research. SenseMaker asks participants to share their  stories in response to a prompt; our prompt asked participants to describe their  experience seeking help with their health during COVID-19. The research team  analyzed the data using simultaneous coding to examine key themes. The results  were discussed with SC staff to validate the coding analysis results before  conducting four focus group discussions to further clarify results and propose  action steps in response to the findings. RESULTS: Many adolescents and youth  reported significant difficulties accessing SRH information and services,  including stigmatization among service providers. Provider biases and negative  attitudes were repeatedly cited as barriers. Stories collected during COVID-19  show how these biases and judgmental attitudes continue to adversely affect  access and use of SRH services for young people. Coercive, non-consensual, and  transactional sexual incidents were reported from adolescents and youth. They  cited reduced time in education spaces as a source of distress as well as  increasing their level of sexual activity and associated risks. Limited data  exists for SRH needs among adolescents and youth during COVID-19 in humanitarian  settings. This study adds to the evidence, making the case for increased SRH  prioritization for adolescents and youth in humanitarian settings, particularly  when facing overlapping crises like during the COVID-19 pandemic.",2022,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,799699,,,4,,Front Reprod Health,,,,,,,,eng,"Copyright © 2022 Meyer, Abimpaye, Harerimana, Williams and Gallagher.",,,,,,Place: Switzerland PMID: 36303625  PMCID: PMC9580758,,,,adolescent; COVID-19; health; humanitarian; refugee; reproductive; sexual; youth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although  experiences of racism are part of the everyday life of many minors affected by  the process of ""Othering"" (e.g., those with an immigrant background), an overview  of empirical findings is missing for this age group worldwide. A systematic  review was conducted to identify and analyze international research on the impact  of discrimination on the developmental outcomes and integration of immigrant  children and adolescents. Three scientific databases were systematically searched  up to June 11, 2021. A total of k = 4,769 identified publications were reviewed  based on inclusion and exclusion criteria in terms of the PICOS format by  independent reviewers. Thirty-four primary studies published between 1998 and  2021 met all inclusion criteria. The samples examined were mainly migrant youth  (k = 30), with only k = 2 studies assessing refugee youth and k = 1 study  assessing both migrant and refugee youth. The majority of included studies  assessed perceived discrimination, with only k = 1 study directly assessing  experiences of racism. The association between discrimination or racism and  developmental outcomes was assessed by the included studies within the three main  topics of (a) mental and physical health-related outcomes (k = 30, e.g.,  self-esteem, depressive symptoms), (b) school-related outcomes (k = 6, e.g.,  academic achievement), and (c) other developmental outcomes (k = 13, e.g.,  misconduct or delinquency). Data collection procedures were implemented, and  findings on minors' developmental outcomes and integration process who experience  discrimination and racism were summarized and discussed. The current review  suggests experienced (racial) discrimination as a negative predictor of children  and adolescents' (mental) health-related outcomes, while no clear results could  be found for the association between discrimination and school-related outcomes.  A need for more empirical research focusing on the path and (possibly) indirect  link between discrimination and children and adolescents' school-related outcomes  as well as resulting school recommendations and the chosen career path was  derived.

METHODS: Syrian refugee children aged between 0 and  18 years were included in the study. Demographic data, diagnosis, particular  interventions due to nephrological problems, and problems encountered during  follow-up were obtained from all participating pediatric nephrology centers.  RESULTS: Data from 633 children from 22 pediatric nephrology centers were  included.

Immigrant and refugee youth should experience better  outcomes to the extent that they (a) maintain strong relationships with  caregivers and peers who provide a sense of closeness, safety, and confidence  during the process of adjusting to this life transition and (b) find ways to  establish a sense of connection and belonging to the new people, places,  communities, and social networks within which they now live. Strong bonds to  people and connection to places (both familiar and new) can counter the social  stratification consequences to minority youth development that are well  articulated in García Coll et al.'s integrative model.

It was hypothesized that  children receiving the intervention would report less externalizing and  internalizing problem behaviors, less posttraumatic functioning, and more  positive classroom social relationships at posttest than children receiving  education as usual, particularly for refugee children. Classes in three  multiethnic Belgian elementary schools were randomly assigned to a creative  intervention (7 classes, 68 students) or control condition (6 classes, 52  students). All participants (8-12 years old) had a migration background. Almost  half (47%) were refugees, 53% were first- to third-generation nonrefugee  immigrants.

This review  underscores the need for interdisciplinary efforts to both mitigate the effects  of trauma faced by migrant and refugee youth emigrating from Mexico and Central  America and, of primary importance, to prevent child exposure to trauma in the  context of migration. Thus, we conclude by outlining policy recommendations aimed  at improving the mental health of migrant and refugee youth.",Sep-21,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,e22158,,6,63,,Dev Psychobiol,,,,,,,,eng,© 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 34292596  PMCID: PMC8410670,,,,*Transients and Migrants; Adolescent; attachment; Central America; Child; early-life stress; emotion regulation; fear learning; frontolimbic circuitry; Humans; Mental Health; Mexico; migrant and refugee children; Neurobiology; parent-child separation; policy; Policy; United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Humanitarian crises disrupt the existing health-care system, limiting  access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services. This review explores the  SRH status of Afghan and Rohingya refugee women of reproductive age in Asia and  their needs and experiences in accessing these services and commodities.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the PRISMA checklist and searched for qualitative  and quantitative peer-reviewed studies from five online bibliographic databases,  SCOPUS, EMBASE (Ovid), MEDLINE (Ovid), CINAHL, and PROQUEST, from January 2000 to  April 2021. Content analysis was undertaken following the minimum initial service  package objectives. RESULTS: Fifteen studies were included in this review from  four countries: Bangladesh (5), Pakistan (5), Iran (4), and Malaysia (1).  Approximately 50.91% of Rohingya and 54% of Afghan refugee women used  contraceptives. About 56.6% of Afghan refugee mothers experienced  pregnancy-related complications, one-third received antenatal care, and low birth  weight was 2.6 times higher among infants born to Afghan refugee mothers than to  Pakistani-born mothers. One out of five Rohingya women received delivery-related  care. Approximately 72% of Rohingya and 79.8% of Afghan refugee women had  experienced gender-based violence, and 56.5% of Rohingya women engaged in  unwanted sexual intercourse with their husbands.

Although experiences vary across settings and subpopulations,  common mental disorders are prevalent among refugee youth who are displaced in  low- and middle-income countries. It is important to examine how risk factors are  intricately linked and contribute to common mental health issues to inform  clinical practice and social policy. AIMS: This study aims to test the pathways  from risk factors previously identified as determinants of Somali refugee youth  mental health (i.e. trauma exposure, substance use, social functioning,  aggression) to symptoms of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and somatic pains. METHOD:  We collected survey data in 2013, using snowball sampling to recruit Somali  refugee youth (15-35 years old) living in Eastleigh, Kenya. We ran three  structural equation models to assess paths from trauma exposure to mental health  symptoms, through psychosocial factors including substance use, aggression, and  functional impairment. We first conducted this analysis with a mixed-gender  sample (N = 305) and then assessed gender differences by running one model for  male participants (n = 124) and another for female participants (n = 181).  RESULTS: In the mixed-gender sample, trauma exposure directly predicted substance  use and both directly and indirectly predicted aggression, functional impairment,  and mental health symptoms. Substance use directly predicted aggression and  functional impairment, and substance use both directly and indirectly predicted  mental health symptoms. The split-gender models revealed gender differences, with  only functional impairment directly predicting mental health symptoms in the male  sample and with many significant direct and indirect pathways in the female  sample.

Furthermore, adolescents' same-ethnic and  cross-ethnic friendships were both positively related to adolescents' social  well-being, and cross-ethnic friendships were also positively associated with  psychological well-being.

Youth are pushed to migrate without parents or guardians to escape war,  persecution, gang violence, and extreme poverty in their country of origin. Youth  are vulnerable to violence and abuse at the hands of smugglers during their  journeys but show great courage and strength as they embark on their journey to a  better life. The goal of this literature review is to provide a synthesis of  empirical literature concerning this population. Thirty-one studies were  included: 13 used qualitative methods, 13 quantitative, four mixed methods, and  one used participatory methods. This body of research documents the stages of  youths' immigration journeys from the decision to leave, to the migration  process, to arriving in the new country and the resettlement experience. The  migration journey was the overarching model in this review, and it describes the  youth's complete journey, which continues after resettlement. We describe the  four stages in the migration process identified in the experience of  unaccompanied youth and their journey in this review: making the decision to  migrate the experience during migration; psychological distress and coping upon  arrival; and adaptation, acculturation upon arrival in the resettlement country,  and impact of social support and social networks in the resettlement country. We  end by offering recommendations for future research and immigration policy based  on what is known and not yet known about the experiences of these courageous  young people.

Our aim was to  identify refugee children's health/wellbeing strengths and needs, and the  barriers and enablers to accessing services while preparing for primary and  secondary school, in a low socio-economic multicultural community in Australia.  METHOD: Ten focus groups were facilitated with Arabic-speaking refugee parents of  children aged 2-5 years (n = 11) or in first year secondary school (n = 22);  refugee adolescents starting high school (n = 16); and key service providers to  refugee families (n = 27). Vignettes about a healthy child and a child with  difficulties guided the discussions. Data was thematically analysed and feedback  sought from the community via the World Café method. RESULTS: Personal resilience  and strong family systems were identified as strengths. Mental health was  identified as a complex primary need; and whilst refugees were aware of available  services, there were issues in knowing how to access them. Opportunities for  play/socialisation were recognised as unmet adolescent needs. Adults spoke of a  need to support integration of ""old"" and ""new"" cultural values. Parents  identified community as facilitating health knowledge transfer for new arrivals;  whilst stakeholders saw this as a barrier when systems change. Most parents had  not heard of early childhood services, and reported difficulty accessing child  healthcare. Preschooler parents identified the family ""GP"" as the main source of  health support; whilst parents of adolescents valued their child's school. Health  communication in written (not spoken) English was a significant roadblock.  Differences in refugee family and service provider perceptions were also evident.

This  discursive article considers the nature and scope of the problem and draws on  literature and current frameworks to suggest the importance of interventions and  proactive protection of mental health for this sub-group of refugees. School is  discussed as a place of primary intervention but also a player in creative and  sophisticated multimodal integrative services. A range of approaches can be, and,  indeed are used in response to mental health issues for children in detention or  upon resettlement. Schooling represents one such solution, providing a  multi-pronged approach to facilitate mental health improvement for these  children. For children needing to recover from loss and trauma secondary to  experiences as a refugee, school offers a developmentally appropriate space to  mobilise and enhance recovery, both at a simple level and as part of more  specialised secondary and tertiary level care. The implications for future  practice among health care professionals is to understand the mental health  plight of refugee children, through both their pre-arrival exposure to trauma and  their post-arrival, detention setting, the key role that schooling can play in  facilitating mental health, and the capacity to advocate for programmes and  services to work collaboratively with schools to achieve greater access for  refugee children.",Aug-19,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,665-671,,8,40,,Issues Ment Health Nurs,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 31074671,,,,Adolescent; Australia; Child; Humans; Mental Disorders/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*therapy; Refugees/*psychology; School Mental Health Services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Uganda is the largest refugee-hosting nation in Africa, hosting  over 1.58 million refugees in 2022, with more than 111,000 living in the city of  Kampala. There is limited information about effective and feasible interventions  to improve mental health outcomes and mental health literacy, and to reduce  mental health stigma among urban refugee adolescents and youth in low- and  middle-income countries (LMICs). Virtual reality (VR) is a promising approach to  reduce stigma and improve mental health and coping, yet such interventions have  not yet been tested in LMICs where most forcibly displaced people reside. Group  Problem Management Plus (GPM+) is a scalable brief psychological transdiagnostic  intervention for people experiencing a range of adversities, but has not been  tested with adolescents and youth to date. Further, mobile health (mHealth)  strategies have demonstrated promise in promoting mental health literacy.  OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness  of two youth-tailored mental health interventions (VR alone and VR combined with  GMP+) in comparison with the standard of care in improving mental health outcomes  among refugee and displaced youth aged 16-24 years in Kampala, Uganda. METHODS: A  three-arm cluster randomized controlled trial will be implemented across five  informal settlements grouped into three sites, based on proximity, and randomized  in a 1:1:1 design. Approximately 330 adolescents (110 per cluster) are enrolled  and will be followed for approximately 16 weeks. Data will be collected at three  time points: baseline enrollment, 8 weeks following enrollment, and 16 weeks  after enrollment. Primary (depression) and secondary outcomes (mental health  literacy, attitudes toward mental help-seeking, adaptive coping, mental health  stigma, mental well-being, level of functioning) will be evaluated. RESULTS: The  study will be conducted in accordance with CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of  Reporting Trials) guidelines. The study has received ethical approval from the  University of Toronto (#40965; May 12, 2021), Mildmay Uganda Research Ethics  Committee (MUREC-2021-41; June 24, 2021), and Uganda National Council for Science  & Technology (SS1021ES; January 1, 2022). A qualitative formative phase was  conducted using focus groups and in-depth, semistructured key informant  interviews to understand contextual factors influencing mental well-being among  urban refugee and displaced youth. Qualitative findings will inform the VR  intervention, SMS text check-in messages, and the adaptation of GPM+.  Intervention development was conducted in collaboration with refugee youth peer  navigators. The trial launched in June 2022 and the final follow-up survey will  be conducted in November 2022. CONCLUSIONS: This study will contribute to the  knowledge of youth-tailored mental health intervention strategies for urban  refugee and displaced youth living in informal settlements in LMIC contexts.  Findings will be shared in peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations,  and with community dissemination.

We measured trauma using a total traumas  experienced variable as well as four trauma types categories  (pre-migration/migration trauma, post-migration trauma, family trauma, and  individual trauma). We measured anxiety and depression symptoms using the Hopkins  Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25) and PTSD using the PTSD Check List - Civilian  Version (PCL-C). We ran descriptive statistics followed by multiple linear  regression models with trauma exposure, education, gender, and willingness to  share problems as predictors of mental health symptoms. Out of 12 possible  traumatic events, most participants (83.7%) reported experiencing at least one  trauma, and participants reported experiencing an average of 3.76 total traumas.  The regression models predicted between 11.5% and 35.5% of the variance of the  mental health symptoms. Willingness to share problems was a significant predictor  of decreased mental health symptoms in most models. These findings highlight the  role of trauma exposure and psychosocial factors in predicting Somali refugee  mental health and indicate that implementing programs to encourage problem  sharing may help address Somali refugee mental health needs.

Methods: Eight staff members of six relevant Communal Integration Centers (CICs)  in NRW were interviewed and a qualitative content analysis was conducted.  Results: The current assignment practices varied widely. The binding to  guidelines differed; additionally, the school assignment or recommendation  largely depended on personal engagement, connections, and attitudes of the  relevant CIC staff. None of the CICs used standardized instruments. Instead, the  staff assessed the performance with self-developed strategies such as free and  playful approaches or self-developed worksheets, and counted on their 'gut  feeling' and professional experience.

Findings reveals that childhood trauma  and impeded social functioning predicted mental health outcomes. Being born in  Kenya was a significant predictor of poor mental health despite there being no  significant difference in trauma exposures and psychosocial factors between  Somali-born and Kenya-born youth. This difference can be attributed to prolonged  displacement, disrupted development of cultural identity, and discrimination  experienced in the host country. Given the widely devastating effects of  childhood trauma and community violence, mental health interventions need to be  two-prolonged: addressing and preventing intergenerational trauma sequelae  through family-based interventions; and community-level programs and advocacy for  safety and protection for the displaced.

We assessed the  synergistic effects of frequent alcohol use, depression and violence on HIV  vulnerability among urban refugee youth aged 16-24 years in Kampala, Uganda.  METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey between January and April 2018  with a convenience sample of refugee youth aged 16-24 years living in informal  settlements in Kampala (Kabalagala, Rubaga, Kansanga, Katwe, Nsambya). We  assessed non-communicable health conditions (frequent [≥3 times per week] alcohol  use [FAU]; depression); violence (young adulthood violence [YAV] at age  ≥16 years, intimate partner violence [IPV]), and HIV vulnerability (past 12-month  transactional sex; recent [past 3-month] multiple [≥2] sex partners). We  calculated the prevalence and co-occurrence of non-communicable health  conditions, violence and HIV vulnerability variables. We then conducted  multivariable logistic regression analyses to first create unique profiles of  FAU, depression, YAV and IPV exposures, and second to assess for interactions  between exposures on HIV vulnerability outcomes. RESULTS: Most participants  (n=445; mean age: 19.59, SD: 2.6; women: n=333, 74.8%, men: n=112, 25.2%)  reported at least one non-communicable health condition or violence exposure  (n=364, 81.8%), and over half (n=278, 62.4%) reported co-occurring exposures.  One-fifth reported FAU (n=90; 20.2%) and one-tenth (n=49; 11%) major depression.  In logistic regression models including all two-way product terms, adjusted for  sociodemographics, we found (a) multiplicative interaction for joint effects of  FAU and IPV (adjusted OR (aOR)=4.81, 95% CI: 1.32 to 17.52) on multiple sex  partners, and (b) multiplicative interaction for joint effects of FAU and IPV  (aOR=3.72, 95% CI: 1.42 to 9.74), and YAV and depression (aOR=7.13, 95% CI: 1.34  to 37.50), on transactional sex.

The  symptomatology of refugee youth was shown to be multifaceted and often falling  outside of traditional diagnoses. Objective: The present study aimed to  investigate the symptomatology of this patient group by assessing the network  structure of a wide range of symptoms. Further, we assessed clinicians'  perceptions of symptoms relations in order to evaluate the clinical validity of  the empirical network. Methods: Empirical data on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder  (PTSD), depression and other trauma symptoms from N = 366 refugee youth were  collected during the routine diagnostic process of an outpatient centre for  refugee youth in Germany. Additionally, four clinicians of this outpatient centre  were asked how they perceive symptom relations in their patients using a newly  developed tool. Separate networks were constructed based on 1) empirical symptom  data and 2) clinicians' perceived symptom relations (PSR). Results: Both the  network based on empirical data and the network based on clinicians' PSR showed  that symptoms of PTSD and depression related most strongly within each respective  cluster (connected mainly via sleeping problems), externalizing symptoms were  somewhat related to PTSD symptoms and intrusions were central. Some differences  were found within the clinicians' PSR as well as between the PSR and the  empirical network. Still, the general PSR-network structure showed a moderate to  good fit to the empirical data. Conclusion: Our results suggest that sleeping  problems and intrusions play a central role in the symptomatology of refugee  children, which has tentative implications for diagnostics and treatment.  Further, externalizing symptoms might be an indicator for PTSD-symptoms. Finally,  using clinicians' PSR for network construction offered a promising possibility to  gain information on symptom networks and their clinical validity.",2021-06-09,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1920200,,1,12,,Eur J Psychotraumatol,,,,,,,,eng,"© 2021 The Author(s).

Methodology This retrospective, cross-sectional study included 400 married  refugee women aged 18-49 years who presented to the Foreigners Outpatient Clinic  between 2018 and 2020. In the Foreigners Outpatient Clinic, a health worker  filled in a 23-question form for all refugee women to obtain their obstetric  history and information regarding contraception methods. The 23-item form  comprised 11 questions about the sociodemographic characteristics of refugee  women, seven questions about their obstetric history, and five questions about  their knowledge and attitudes about contraception methods. Statistical analyses  were performed using the data obtained from these forms filed in the outpatient  clinic. Descriptive data were presented as frequency, percentage distribution,  mean, and standard deviation. Results The average age of the participants was  31.36 ± 8.36 years, with 52.8% of the participants being Afghan women. Overall,  70% of participants were either only literate, learned to read and write without  ever going to school, or were primary school graduates. Moreover, 61.1% of  refugee women aged ≤18 years at the time of first birth were Somali, Sudanese,  and Saudi Arabian nationals, significantly outnumbering other refugee women (p =  0.03). The rate of having ≥three children among Pakistani participants was 90.0%,  which was statistically significantly higher (p = 0.04). The proportion of Afghan  women who received counseling on family planning was lower (p = 0.04). There was  no statistically significant difference between refugee women's knowledge of  using a contraception method (p = 0.09). As a contraception method, the most  significant use of injection was by refugee women from Somalia, Sudan, and Saudi  Arabia (p = 0.03); tubal ligation was used by Afghan women (p = 0.01); and  implanted by Pakistani women (p = 0.01). No difference was found in the use of  condoms, pills, and intrauterine devices. Conclusions On evaluating the obstetric  characteristics of refugee women, it was determined that the number of  pregnancies and the rate of giving first birth at the age of 18 and under were  high. On the other hand, there was no difference between refugee women regarding  condom and pill use; however, it was observed that the rate of using these  methods at some point in their lives was high. Hence, it can be concluded that  immigration seriously affects women's reproductive health, makes it difficult to  obtain protection methods, and paves the way for having unplanned and large  numbers of children.",Apr-22,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,e24045,,4,14,,Cureus,,,,,,,,eng,"Copyright © 2022, Korkut et al.",,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 35463558  PMCID: PMC9000783,,,,contraceptive methods; migration; obstetric history; refugee; women,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Half of these refugees are children, whose age and refugee status  jeopardize their abilities to attain quality healthcare. Information on Syrian  refugees' health in the U.S. is limited. This qualitative study sought to explore  Syrian refugee parents' beliefs, perspectives, and practices regarding their  children's health through in-depth interviews. METHODS: Eighteen Syrian refugee  parents residing in Cincinnati, Ohio were interviewed in Arabic by bilingual  researchers using semi-structured in-depth interviews. The interviews were  recorded, transcribed, and translated. Three members of the research team  independently coded each interview using an inductive thematic analysis approach.  RESULTS: Analysis identified four salient themes: stressors preclude health  seeking behaviors, parents perceive health barriers, parents are dissatisfied  with the healthcare system, and parents use resilience behaviors to overcome  barriers. Stressors included poor housing and neighborhoods, reliving traumatic  experiences, depression and anxiety, and social isolation. Dissatisfaction  included emergency room wait times, lack of testing and prescriptions. Health  barriers included missed appointments and inadequate transportation, translation  services, health literacy and care coordination. Parents reported resilience  through faith, by seeking knowledge, use of natural remedies, and utilizing  community resources. CONCLUSION: This qualitative study provides information on  the beliefs, practices, and behaviors of Syrian refugee parents related to health  care utilization of pediatric refugees in the United States. Psychosocial and  environmental stressors as well as perceived systemic health barriers, hinder  health seeking behaviors in Syrian refugee parents.

A Comparison between Refugee Youth and Youth of Immigrant  Descent.,International journal of environmental research and public health,,1660-4601 1661-7827,10.3390/ijerph182212016,,"Applying a risk and protection perspective, this study paid special attention to the protective roles of parental and peer support in the face of perceived ethnic  discrimination (PED) at school. Responding to the inconsistent findings of  previous research, the survey study provides greater clarity regarding the  interactions between PED at school, social support and positive adjustment  (self-esteem, self-efficacy, optimism and school integration). The sample  comprised 104 ethnic-minority youth (M(age) = 17.73, SD = 3.29, 61% female),  including refugee youth (n = 55) and second- and third-generation youth of  immigrant descent (n = 49). Structural equation models across the whole sample  confirmed peer support as a significant moderator, indicating that  ethnic-minority youth who received low peer support were less optimistic when  facing PED. In multi-group models, we tested whether results differ across  refugee youth and youth of immigrant descent. Results revealed between-group  differences concerning the moderating roles of parental and peer support: For  youth of immigrant descent, while more PED was associated with lower self-esteem  when receiving low parental support, we found a positive association between PED  and optimism when receiving high parental support. Based on the findings that  refugee youth were shown to be less optimistic when obtaining low peer support,  the main interaction effect for peer support on optimism seemed to be driven by  refugee youth. The results of our cross-sectional study highlight the importance  of identifying specific social support factors for specific adjustment outcomes  and also the importance of differentiating between minority groups. Further, the  findings offer practical implications for the educational sector in terms of  programs focusing on the development of peer-support networks to especially  promote refugee youth resilience and resettlement in Germany.",2021-11-16,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,22,18,,Int J Environ Res Public Health,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: Switzerland PMID: 34831802  PMCID: PMC8625724,,,,*Emigrants and Immigrants; *Racism; *Refugees; Adolescent; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Minority Groups; Peer Group; perceived ethnic discrimination; positive adjustment; refugee youth; social support; youth of immigrant descent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This Four Core Stressors framework  can be used to educate providers about these populations' unique needs and  support assessment of relevant socioecological factors influencing health. To  facilitate education, training, and dissemination of this framework and  complement existing provider resources, we developed the Refugee & Immigrant Core  Stressors Toolkit (RICST), a free, web-based toolkit that provides an overview of  the Four Core Stressors framework, assessment questions across the four domains,  scaffolding to identify needs and points of triage, and recommended  interventions. Public hosting of the RICST via REDCap began in March 2018. In  addition to the toolkit, users are prompted to provide location of service  delivery, intended purpose of use, and interface feedback. Between March 2018 and  October 2020, the RICST was used over 2300 times across 6 continents. Most  providers used the toolkit to learn more about the needs of refugee and immigrant  youth in general, and several noted that it is a valuable educational tool for  staff unfamiliar with these populations. Open-ended qualitative feedback  indicated high usability. Amidst historically high levels of forced displacement,  tools to support provider effectiveness in working with these populations are  increasingly needed.

Because beta-thalassemia  (BT) is a prevalent disorder in the Mediterranean countries, we decided to  estimate the prevalence of and make an overview of the demographic,  socioeconomic, medical characteristics, and healthcare problems of refugee  children with BT. PATIENTS: Eighteen Turkish Pediatric Hematology Oncology  Centers (PHOC) with 318 refugee children from 235 families participated in the  study. The mean age of the patients was 8.1 ± 4.8 years (0.5-21 years). The mean  time after immigration to Turkey was 2.5 ± 1.5 years (range, 0.1-7 years).

We used a later iteration of Bronfenbrenner's bioecological model of  human development - the PPCT model - to consolidate evidence. RESULTS: We  identify a range of risk and protective factors operating at individual,  familial, community and institutional and policy levels that influence outcomes  for refugee children. The dynamics shaping the interaction of these influences  are linked to the life course principles of socio-historical time and  developmental age, proximal processes and child agency. CONCLUSIONS: Actions at  individual, familial, community, school, institutional and policy levels all have  potential traction on mental health and psychosocial well-being of refugee  children.

METHODS: Youth aged  16-25 years, with an incident diagnosis of CMD (depression, post-traumatic stress  disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorders) accessing specialized healthcare in Sweden  2006-2016 were included. New users were identified with a one-year washout  period. Refugees (N=1575) were compared with Swedish-born youth (N=2319). Cox  regression models [reported as adjusted Hazard Ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence  intervals (CIs)] were used to investigate factors associated with discontinuation  of antidepressant use. RESULTS: Among youth (mean age 20.9 years, SD 2.7, 50%  females), the median duration of antidepressant use differed considerably between  refugee (101 days, IQR 31-243) and Swedish-born youth (252 days, IQR 101-558).

However, their actual mechanism of impact  remains under-researched. The aim of this study was therefore to explore  protective and promotive resilience mechanisms to inform future interventions and  policy. Promotive resilience is seen as a direct main effect and protective  resilience as a moderating effect. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of  Syrian youth recently resettled in Norway, aged 13-24 years. Regression and  moderation analyses were used to explore different interactions, including  moderated mediation using the PROCESS macro for SPSS. Result: A direct main  effect of promotive resilience was found for health-related quality of life  (HRQoL) and general mental distress, but not for post-traumatic stress disorder  (PTSD). No moderating effects of protective resilience were found. Post-migration  stressors mediated the effects of potentially traumatic events (PTE) from war and  flight, and this indirect effect was present at all levels of resilience.  Conclusion: Despite high risk exposure and mental distress, resilience was also  high. Broad resilience interventions targeting multiple factors would likely  benefit the group, but these should include both individual assets and building  supportive environments. Additionally, reducing current stress and providing  treatment for those in need could enable recovery and increase the efficacy of  resilience factors already present.",2021,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,711451,,,9,,Front Public Health,,,,,,,,eng,"Copyright © 2021 Dangmann, Solberg, Myhrene Steffenak, Høye and Andersen.",,,,,,Place: Switzerland PMID: 34631646  PMCID: PMC8494783,,,,*Refugees; Adolescent; Cross-Sectional Studies; health-related quality of life; Humans; mental distress; Norway/epidemiology; post-migration stressors; post-traumatic stress disorder; Quality of Life; refugee; resilience; Syria; youth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Warzone exposure and forced migration have unique acute and chronic impacts on youth, yet  effects of exposure may not be universal across diverse refugee groups.  Understanding how youth from various refugee groups are differentially affected  by stress and trauma is critical to allocate resources and implement screening  measures with the goal of providing early intervention. METHOD: To identify the  effects of warzone exposure and forced migration, a convenience sample of 48  Iraqi refugee youth ages 6-17 was assessed within the first month of arrival to  the United States. Youth provided self-reported severity of posttraumatic stress  and anxiety symptoms; symptom severity was then compared with an existing sample  of 135 Syrian refugee youth to explore whether refugee youth of different  nationalities experience the same effects of warzone exposure and forced  migration. These data are the baseline for a longitudinal developmental study of  refugee health, which also includes parental data. RESULTS: Severity of  separation anxiety and negative alterations in cognition and mood were the  greatest symptomatic concerns in Iraqi refugee youth. Thirty-eight percent of  responding Iraqi youth showed possible indication of an anxiety disorder.  Severity of posttraumatic stress symptoms was lower in Iraqi youth compared to  Syrian youth. For both Iraqi and Syrian refugee youth, separation anxiety was the  most significant concern, with more than 80% of both samples showing a possible  indication of clinically significant separation anxiety. CONCLUSION: The present  observational study indicated that Iraqi refugee youth experience a range of  anxiety and posttraumatic stress symptoms following warzone exposure and forced  migration; posttraumatic stress symptoms were less severe in Iraqi versus Syrian  youth. Comparing refugee youth of different nationalities is of particular  importance, as our results demonstrate that findings from one refugee population  cannot easily be generalized to another. Clinical and research efforts should  prioritize interventions to address separation anxiety in refugee youth, which  was of concern in both samples.",2021,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,574368,,,12,,Front Psychol,,,,,,,,eng,"Copyright © 2021 Grasser, Haddad, Manji, Assari, Arfken and Javanbakht.",,,,,,Place: Switzerland PMID: 33828500  PMCID: PMC8019895,,,,anxiety; developmental psychology; mental health; psychiatry; psychological stress; PTSD; refugees; trauma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Participants were 6-18-year-old children (n = 212) and their mothers  (n = 94), who fled from Syria and were residing in Turkish communities. We used  the computer-based emotional processing task including photos of facial movements  typically associated with different emotions to measure children's capacity for  emotional processing. Mothers reported their PTS and the discipline types they  use, as well as the contextual factors related to their refugee background.  Linear mixed effect models were constructed first, to find out the discipline  types that are most strongly associated with emotional processing of the child,  and second, to examine whether these discipline types moderate the effect of  maternal PTS on children's emotional processing. Finally, generalized linear  models were constructed to examine which contextual factors are associated with  the use of these discipline types by mothers. We found that spanking as a  discipline type was associated with poorer child emotional processing, whereas  withholding of media access was associated with better emotional processing.  Younger and less religious mothers were more prone to use spanking.

METHODS: This qualitative community-based study with urban refugee  and displaced youth aged 16-24 living in Kampala's informal settlements involved  five focus groups (FG), including two with young women, two with young men, and  one with sex workers from March to May 2019. We also conducted five in-depth key  informant interviews. We conducted thematic analysis informed by Campbell and  Cornish's conceptualisation of material and symbolic contexts.

Participant narratives  reflected material and symbolic contexts that shaped HIV testing awareness,  preferences and uptake. Material contextual factors that presented barriers to  HIV testing and prevention engagement included transportation costs to clinics,  overcrowded living conditions that limited access to private spaces, low literacy  and language barriers. Symbolic contexts that constrained HIV testing engagement  included medical mistrust of HIV testing and inequitable gender norms. Religion  emerged as an opportunity to connect with refugee communities and to address  conservative religious positions on HIV and sexual health.

Collaborative mental health care  in school forms a particular practice of school-based mental health care  provision. Developed in Canada and inspired by systemic intervention approaches,  collaborative mental health care in schools involves the formation of an  interdisciplinary care network, in which mental health care providers and school  partners collaborate with each other and the refugee family in a joint assessment  of child development and mental health, as well as joint intervention planning  and provision. It aims to move away from an individual perspective on refugee  children's development, toward an engagement with refugee families' perspectives  on their migration histories, cultural background and social condition in shaping  assessment and intervention, as such fostering refugee empowerment, equality, and  participation in the host society. Relating to the first stage of van Yperen's  four-stage model for establishing evidence-based youth care, this article aims to  engage in an initial exploration of the effectiveness of a developing  school-based collaborative mental health care practice in Leuven, Belgium.

However, research into these outcomes  disproportionately focuses on cross-sectional data in high-income countries. We  aimed to (1) investigate change in resilience across two timepoints in a highly  vulnerable sample of Syrian refugee children in Lebanon, and (2) explore  predictors of their mental health problems across time. METHODS: In total, 982  Syrian child-caregiver dyads living in refugee settlements in Lebanon completed  questionnaires via interview at baseline and follow-up one year later. We  categorised children into groups based on their risk for mental health problems  across both timepoints (stable high risk/SHR, deteriorating, improving, stable  low risk) according to locally validated cut-offs on measures of post-traumatic  stress disorder (PTSD), depression and behavioural problems. Analyses of  covariance identified how the groups differed on a range of individual and  socio-environmental predictors, followed up by cross-lagged panel models (CLPMs)  to investigate the directionality of the relationships between significantly  related predictors and symptoms. RESULTS: The sample showed a meaningful amount  of change in mental health symptoms from baseline to follow-up. Over half (56.3%)  of children met SHR criteria and 10.3% deteriorated over time, but almost  one-quarter (24.2%) showed meaningful improvement, and 9.2% were consistently at  low risk for mental health problems at both timepoints. Several predictors  differentiated the groups, particularly social measures. According to CLPMs,  maternal acceptance (β = -0.07) predicted child mental health symptoms over time.  Self-esteem (β = -0.08), maternal psychological control (β = 0.10), child  maltreatment (β = 0.09) and caregiver depression (β = 0.08) predicted child  symptoms and vice versa (β(se) = -0.11, β(b) = 0.07, β(mpc) = 0.08, β(cm) = 0.1,  β(cd) = 0.11). Finally, child symptoms predicted loneliness (β = 0.12), bullying  (β = 0.07), perceived social support (β = -0.12), parent-child conflict (β =  0.13), caregiver PTSD (β = 0.07), caregiver anxiety (β = 0.08) and the perceived  refugee environment (β = -0.09). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show risk and  resilience are dynamic, and the family environment plays a key role in children's  response to war and displacement. Conversely, children also have a significant  impact on the family environment and caregiver's own mental health.

Mothers and children were the most  negatively affected among the Syrian refugees who had to migrate from their  countries as a result of the civil war in Syria. One of the most important issues  in terms of child health is breastfeeding. Breastfeeding in migrants should be  promoted worldwide to mitigate infant mortality and diseases. The aim of this  study is to examine the association between breastfeeding status in Syrian  refugee children under two years and socio-demographic characteristics of Syrian  refugee mothers with further analysis of Turkey Demographic and Health  Survey-Syrian Migrant-2018 (TDHS-SM-2018) data.  METHODS: The data source is the  TDHS-SM-2018. Data for the last-born children with a gestational duration greater  than 32 weeks from the mothers' singleton pregnancy, aged less than two years old  and living with the mother were included (unweighted n = 744). The dependent  variable was the breastfeeding status (breastfeeding in the last 24 h during the  study period) in children under two years. Complex sample logistic regression  evaluated the associations. RESULTS: The percentage of breastfeeding in children  under the age of two years was found to be 62.4%, and the total median  breastfeeding duration was 14.6 months. Univariate analysis showed that the  earlier mothers immigrated to Turkey, the higher the current breastfeeding rate.  Breastfeeding rates were found to be higher among people living in the South and  East regions (65.2% and 65.1% respectively). Multivariable binary complex sample  logistic regression revealed that breastfeeding status at the study period was  associated with long preceding birth interval; delivery in a public hospital;  absence of prelacteal feeding; being non-pregnant; and the region and age of the  child. No relationship for current breastfeeding was found with maternal  activities, maternal life satisfaction, financial satisfaction, and educational  status. CONCLUSION: Current breastfeeding in our sample was more likely among  mothers with a longer birth interval who avoided prelacteal feeding.

This  project aimed to use photovoice to assess and increase awareness on public health  problems faced by young refugees in Turkey, as well as involve young people in  health promotion research and have their voices heard by policy makers. The  qualitative study was conducted with young people experiencing forced migration  and with local youth aged 18 to 30 years in Turkey. The methodology involved  representing problems through photographs taken by participants and conducting  discussions among both refugee and local youth groups, followed by dissemination  and advocacy activities such as producing publications and organizing photo  exhibitions that brought together policy makers, health service providers, civil  society organizations, refugees, and host communities to achieve positive change  through joint action. Through the photovoice process, we found that although  health care services were widely available for registered refugees, many faced  language, financial, cultural, and educational barriers—as well as gender and  stigma-related barriers—to accessing health information, health services, and  healthy environments. Using photovoice, as a CBPAR approach, had numerous  advantages, such as the creation of visual findings that were more impactful than  written material, the opportunity to work with vulnerable/disadvantaged groups  throughout the research process, and increasing interaction between different  stakeholders.

Eighteen participants  completed individual photography projects that revealed consumption of soda,  processed foods, limited calcium-rich foods, and limited evidence of physical  activity. Photography project results and topics from nutrition education  provided during the program were used to tailor health promotion resources.  Students used digital cameras and props to create visual health-promoting  materials (e.g., large posters for school hallways) that included and represented  the wide range of cultures and ethnicities at the school.

We explored the relationship between  refugee presence and a host community's resilience in nutrition outcomes in  Cameroon. We also tested an analytical framework for evaluating community  resilience during shocks. We used data from repeated cross-sectional Demographic  and Health Surveys in Cameroon (2004 and 2011), data on refugee movement, and  data on extreme climatic events, epidemics, and conflicts from multiple sources.  Outcome variables were maternal underweight, maternal anaemia, and child  underweight, anaemia, stunting and wasting. The exposure variable was residence  within an area in which refugees settled. We used a genetic matching algorithm to  select controls from the rest of the country after excluding areas experiencing  concurrent shocks. We used a difference-in-differences analysis to compare  outcomes between the exposed and control areas. The 2004 survey comprised 10,656  women and 8,125 children, while the 2011 survey comprised 15,426 women and 11,732  children.

Objectives: To examine the  prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other mental health  problems among Burundian refugee children and their parents living in Tanzanian  refugee camps and to identify patterns of comorbidity among children and their  parents based on PTSD symptom levels and functional impairment. Methods: We  recruited a representative sample of 230 children aged 7-15 years and both of  their parents (n = 690) and conducted separate structured clinical interviews.  Latent Class Analysis was applied to identify patterns of comorbidity. Results:  Children and parents were exposed to multiple traumatic event types. In total,  5.7% of children fulfilled DSM-5 criteria for PTSD in the past month and 10.9%  reported enhanced levels of other mental health problems. 42.6% indicated  clinically significant functional impairment due to PTSD symptoms. PTSD  prevalence was higher among mothers (32.6%) and fathers (29.1%). Latent Class  Analysis (LCA) revealed a familial accumulation of PTSD symptoms as children with  high symptom levels and impairment were likely to live in families with two  traumatized parents. Conclusions: Although the number of children who need  support for trauma-related mental health problems was relatively low, taking into  account parental trauma could aid to identify at-risk children with elevated PTSD  symptom levels and impairment even in the face of existing barriers to mental  health care access for children in refugee camp settings (e.g. lack of targeted  services, prioritization of managing daily stressors).",2019,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1676005,,1,10,,Eur J Psychotraumatol,,,,,,,,eng,"© 2019 The Author(s).

In pre-schools, teachers'  professional competence for teaching those children and adapting to their  socio-emotional needs has become increasingly important. Previous research linked  teachers' stereotypes and cultural beliefs to their self-efficacy and enthusiasm  when teaching immigrant children. This study investigated the links between  domains of pre-school teachers' professional competence (i.e., negative  stereotypes, multicultural beliefs, self-efficacy, and enthusiasm when teaching  newly arrived refugee children), and examined whether teachers' professional  competence was linked to their perceptions of newly arrived refugee children's  behavior problems. Method: In a cross-sectional self-report survey, N = 147  German pre-school teachers reported on their professional competence and  completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) for a selected  refugee child from their pre-school group. We used regression modeling to link  teachers' negative stereotypes and multicultural beliefs to their self-efficacy  and enthusiasm for teaching refugee children. Next, we examined the links between  teachers' beliefs, values, and motivational orientations to their ratings on the  SDQ subscales. Last, we linked demographic data on teachers and children to  teachers' professional competence and SDQ ratings. Results: Teachers with more  negative stereotypes toward newly arrived refugee children and less agreement  with multicultural beliefs reported lower self-efficacy and enthusiasm for  teaching newly arrived refugee children. Teachers with more negative stereotypes  perceived more hyperactivity/inattention and total difficulties. Teachers with  higher self-efficacy perceived less hyperactivity/inattention, less total  difficulties, and more prosocial behavior. Additionally, teachers who had more  experience with refugee children reported more negative stereotypes and higher  agreement with multicultural beliefs. Teachers having more overall work  experience perceived more total difficulties. Boys were perceived to display more  externalizing behavior problems, less prosocial behavior, and more total  difficulties. Older children were perceived as displaying more prosocial behavior  and children from African countries were perceived as displaying more conduct  problems. Discussion: Our findings suggest that pre-school teachers' stereotypes  and self-efficacy might be related to perception biases concerning newly arrived  refugee children's externalizing behavior problems. Implications for the  professional development of pre-school teachers and teacher-informant diagnostics  of refugee children's socio-emotional needs are discussed.",2020,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,574412,,,11,,Front Psychiatry,,,,,,,,eng,"Copyright © 2021 Chwastek, Leyendecker, Heithausen, Ballero Reque and Busch.",,,,,,Place: Switzerland PMID: 33584360  PMCID: PMC7873434,,,,childcare; early education; mental health; perception; pre-school; refugee; SDQ; teacher,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND ANALYSIS:  This study will be conducted in Bidi Bidi. We conducted a qualitative formative  phase with focus groups (n=40) to generate knowledge of barriers and facilitators  of HIV prevention, testing and care among refugee youth (aged 16-24) in Bidi  Bidi. These findings were used to create comic scenarios aligning with  edutainment approaches to health promotion and inform a four-arm cluster  randomised controlled trial in Bidi Bidi using a 2×2 factorial design: (1) HIV  self-testing alongside edutainment comics, (2) HIV self-testing alone, (3)  edutainment comic alone and (4) standard of care. The target sample size will be  120 youth (30 per arm), who will be enrolled in the trial and followed for 3  months. Data will be collected at baseline and 3 months after enrolment.

Informed by an ecological framework, this study examined the post-migration  adjustment of refugee children and adolescents 2-3 years after arrival to  Australia. We aimed to estimate the overall rate of adjustment among young  refugees and explore associations with adjustment and factors across individual,  family, school, and community domains, using a large and broadly representative  sample. METHODS: Data were drawn from Wave 3 of the Building a New Life in  Australia (BNLA) study, a nationally representative, longitudinal study of  settlement among humanitarian migrants in Australia. Caregivers of refugee  children aged 5-17 (N = 694 children and adolescents) were interviewed about  their children's physical health and activity, school absenteeism and  achievement, family structure and parenting style, and community and  neighbourhood environment. Parent and child forms of the Strengths and  Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) were completed by caregivers and older children  to assess social and emotional adjustment. RESULTS: Sound adjustment according to  the SDQ was observed regularly among young refugees, with 76-94% (across gender  and age) falling within normative ranges. Comparison with community data for  young people showed that young refugees had comparable or higher adjustment  levels than generally seen in the community. However, young refugees as a group  did report greater peer difficulties. Bivariate and multivariate linear  regression analyses showed that better reported physical health and school  achievement were associated with higher adjustment. Furthermore, higher school  absenteeism and endorsement of a hostile parenting style were associated with  lower adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to report on child  psychosocial outcomes from the large, representative longitudinal BNLA study.

METHODS: We  performed a systematic review of quantitative literature regarding psychological  and contextual factors that contribute to resilience in refugee children residing  in high-income countries. Our procedure followed guidelines from the Centre for  Reviews and Dissemination. RESULTS: We identified a number of protective factors  as related to positive outcomes. They are drawn from several ecological domains  and include age, self-esteem, maintenance of cultural identity, social support,  belonging and safety and innovative social care services. A key overarching point  reported by the studies we reviewed was that for refugee settlement specific  policies and approaches to be beneficial, they were required to be embedded  within a positive socially inclusive society. We also identified several  limitations across the reported studies. CONCLUSION: The factors we identified  would assist clinicians to adopt a resilience-focussed approach.

However, issues related to acute healthcare provision for refugee children across  Europe remain unexplored. This study aimed to describe the urgent and emergency  healthcare needs of refugee children in Europe, and to identify obstacles to  providing this care. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey was distributed to  European healthcare professionals via research networks between 1 February and 1  October 2017 addressing health issues of children and young people aged <18 years  fulfilling international criteria of refugee status, presenting to emergency  departments. Survey domains explored (1) respondent's institution, (2) local  healthcare system, (3) available guidance and educational tools, (4) perceived  obstacles and improvements required, (5) countries of origin of refugee children  being seen and (6) presenting signs and symptoms of refugee children. RESULTS:  One hundred and forty-eight respondents from 23 European countries completed the  survey, and most worked in academic institutions (n=118, 80%). Guidance on  immunisations was available for 30% of respondents, and on safeguarding issues  (31%), screening for infection (32%) or mental health (14%).

CONCLUSIONS: Many hospitals are not adequately prepared for providing urgent  and emergency care to refugee children and young people. Although clinicians are  generally well equipped to deal with most types and severity of presenting  illnesses, we identified specific obstacles such as language barriers, mental  health issues, safeguarding issues and lack of information on previous medical  history.

In a model based on earlier theory, we  tested if post-migration stressors and mental distress mediated the effect of  PTEs on HRQoL, individually and in serial. We also explored how different types  of post-migration stressors influenced different dimensions of HRQoL. METHODS:  This study used a cross-sectional design where 160 Syrian youth recently  resettled in Norway completed questionnaires at school between May and December  2018. Correlations between types of post-migration stressors and dimensions of  HRQoL were explored and a serial multiple mediator model was tested. Models were  adjusted for age and gender, using two types of mental distress; post-traumatic  stress disorder (PTSD) and general mental distress. RESULTS: Higher levels of  PTEs reduced experienced HRQoL, but this direct effect was mediated by  post-migration stressors alone and in serial with mental distress. Despite high  levels of mental distress, this did not affect HRQoL independently, only in  serial mediation with increased post-migration stressors. Economic concerns and  discrimination were types of post-migration stressors affecting several  dimensions of HRQoL. CONCLUSION: Quality of life in refugee is affected by past  events from war, stressors in current resettlement and elevated mental distress  through complex interrelations.

Within  the last few years, a large number of families with young children have sought  refuge in Germany. However, children's mental health status in Germany is mostly  unclear. A central aim of developmental psychopathology is to understand how risk  factors lead to the emergence of mental health concerns. One approach to  investigating this association is the study of specificity, which describes the  idea that specific risk factors are related to specific psychological outcomes.  The aim of our study was to assess the mental health status of young refugee  children in Germany, and to explore a potential refugee-specific mental health  pattern. In two studies, we assessed mental health outcomes of 93 children from  Syria or Iraq, aged 1.5-5 years, who recently arrived in Germany. The results  were compared to U.S. norm data of typically developing children, and to norm  data of a clinical sample in order to explore mental health patterns. In the  first study (n = 35), we used standardized screening tools for parents (CBCL  1.5-5). In the second study (n = 58), mental health states of refugee children  were assessed by caretakers (CTRF 1.5-5). In comparison to U.S. norm data of  normally developing children, refugee parents reported more mental health  concerns for their children, especially on syndrome scales of internalizing  difficulties. A comparison to U.S. clinical reference data showed a specific  mental health pattern, characterized by increased levels of anxiety/depression,  attention problems, and withdrawal behavior. Caretakers, too, reported more  mental health problems compared to typically developing children, albeit to a  smaller extent. However, a comparison to clinically-referred children only led to  partial confirmation of a specific mental health pattern. Our studies offer  important insights into the mental health status and pattern of young refugee  children, which is essential for preventing the onset of psychopathology and for  offering tailored interventions.",2018,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,212,,,9,,Front Psychiatry,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: Switzerland PMID: 29887810  PMCID: PMC5981028,,,,CBCL; CTRF; early childhood; mental health; prevalence; PTSD; refugees; specificity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lack of anaemia prevalence estimates among the displaced inhibit  global planning for anaemia reduction. METHODS: We analysed population  representative, cross-sectional nutrition surveys from 2013 to 2016 conducted by  the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and partner agencies. Included  surveys measured haemoglobin concentration among children 6-59 months,  non-pregnant women 15-49 years, or both groups. For each survey, we calculated  mean haemoglobin and prevalence of total anaemia (<110 g/L in children, <120 g/L  in women), and classified public health severity following WHO guidelines.  Pearson correlations between indicators from women and children surveys were  calculated where both subpopulations were measured. RESULTS: Analysis included  196 surveys among children and 184 surveys among women from 121 unique refugee  settings in 24 countries. The median prevalence of total anaemia in children and  women was 44% and 28%, respectively. Sixty-one per cent of child surveys  indicated a problem of severe public health importance compared with 25% of  surveys in women. The prevalence of total anaemia in children and women was  strongly correlated (ρ=0.80). Median prevalence of total anaemia was  approximately 55% greater and mean haemoglobin was 6 g/L lower among children age  6-23 months compared with children 24-59 months. West and Central Africa region  had the highest median prevalence of anaemia both in women and children.  CONCLUSION: While the burden of anaemia is high among the displaced, it mirrors  that of the general population. Haemoglobin should continue to be measured in  nutrition surveys in refugee settings. Sustained, multisectoral efforts to reduce  anaemia are needed, with specific focus on children under 2 years of age and  refugee settings in the West and Central Africa region.",2019,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,e001837,,6,4,,BMJ Glob Health,,,,,,,,eng,© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near  East (UNRWA) is the primary healthcare provider for Palestine refugees. To better  inform UNRWA's health programme, we conducted this study to assess the prevalence  and determinants of malnutrition among Palestine refugee children in Jordan and  to analyse caregiver perceptions of food insecurity and structural barriers to  accessing food. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with a randomly  selected sample of 405 households, for children under 5 years old in two refugee  camps in Jordan, Jerash and Souf. Sociodemographic, food insecurity, diet quality  and child anthropometric data were collected. Also, twenty in-depth interviews  were conducted with children's caregivers, along with two focus group discussions  with UNRWA staff. RESULTS: Out of the 367 participants, the prevalence of  stunting was 23.8% in Jerash and 20.4% in Souf (p=0.46), and overweight was 18.2%  versus 7.1%, respectively (p=0.008). However, high food insecurity in Jerash was  45.7% and 26.5% in Souf (p=0.001), with no significant difference after  multivariable adjustment. Qualitative perspectives saw food insecurity and  low-quality children's diets as largely mediated by job and income insecurity,  especially marked in Jerash due to the lack of Jordanian citizenship. CONCLUSION:  We found a moderate-to-high prevalence of stunting and overweight levels among  Palestine refugee children, which are three times higher than the 2012  Demographic and Health Survey data for Jordanian non-refugee children. High rates  of household food insecurity were closely tied to households' lack of essential  civil and economic rights.

It was hypothesized  that a combination of pre-trauma variables (age and gender), trauma-specific  variables (traumatic events and time spent in host country, and host country),  and post-trauma variables (coping strategies, family relationships, and school  environment) would be associated with PTSD and emotion dysregulation.  PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Participants were 1000 Syrian refugee children and  adolescents aged 7-18 years attending formal and non-formal schools representing  various governorates in Lebanon and Jordan. METHODS: The trauma exposure scale,  DSM-IV criteria for the assessment of PTSD, the Difficulties in Emotion  Regulation Scale Short Form, Kidcope, Family relationship scales, and school  environment scale were administered in an interview format with children and  adolescents at school by two trained psychologists. Multivariate binary logistic  regression was used to predict PTSD whereas hierarchical multiple regression was  used to predict emotion dysregulation. RESULTS: Results indicated that 45.6% of  the refugees have developed PTSD with excessive risk for comorbidity with emotion  dysregulation. Emotion dysregulation was reported by older refugee children and  adolescents. The prevalence of PTSD was higher in refugee children and  adolescents who had resettled in Lebanon than for those who had resettled in  Jordan. Refugee children and adolescents who were exposed to higher levels of war  atrocities evidenced the greatest prevalence of PTSD and emotion dysregulation.  PTSD symptomatology and emotion dysregulation in children and adolescents varied  according to coping styles, family relationships, and school environment. Both  decreased significantly with the passage of time spent in host country.  CONCLUSIONS: The results may be used to formulate cognitive-behavioral coping  interventions that can lead to optimal developmental outcomes in the posttrauma  environment.",Mar-19,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,29-39,,,89,,Child Abuse Negl,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition to detailed assessment of parent-rated parent  and child symptomatology, we focused on disruptive behaviors in the education  environment summarized as survival states, as these frequently lead to clinical  referral. METHODS: We screened 52 refugee children aged 3-7 (M = 5.14 years,  SD = 1.17) for symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) with the Child  and Adolescent Trauma Screening (CATS) in parent rating. The parents' mental  health was assessed using the Refugee Health Screener (RHS-15). Furthermore, the  child's educators were asked to evaluate the pathological survival states of the  child and we made a general assessment of the children's symptoms with the  Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) rated by parents and educators.  Children in the refugee sample completed a working memory learning task (Subtest  Atlantis from the Kaufmann Assessment Battery for Children, KABC-II) and  delivered saliva samples for testing of the cortisol level. RESULTS: The parental  rating of their child's PTSD symptoms was significantly related to their own  mental well-being (r = .50, p < .001). Children with survival states in educator  ratings exhibited weaker learning performance (F = 3.49, p < .05) and higher  evening cortisol levels (U = 113, z = - 1.7, p < .05, one-tailed). CONCLUSIONS:  Survival states are promising indicators for children's learning performance and  distress level complementary to parent rating of child PTSD, which is highly  intercorrelated with the parents' own symptom load.

From the  onset of the war, infectious disease surveillance and healthcare systems were  severely disrupted. Prior to the reestablishment of dependable infectious disease  surveillance systems, and during the early months of the conflict, our  international team of pediatricians, infectious disease specialists, and  population health scientists assessed the health implications for child and  adolescent populations. The invasion occurred just as the COVID-19 Omicron surge  was peaking throughout Europe and Ukrainian children had not received COVID-19  vaccines. In addition, vaccine coverage for multiple vaccine-preventable  diseases, most notably measles, was alarmingly low as Ukrainian children and  adolescents were forced to migrate from their home communities, living  precariously as internally displaced persons inside Ukraine or streaming into  European border nations as refugees. The incursion created immediate impediments  in accessing HIV treatment services, aimed at preventing serial transmission from  HIV-positive persons to adolescent sexual or drug-injection partners and to  prevent vertical transmission from HIV-positive pregnant women to their newborns.  The war also led to new-onset, conflict-associated, preventable infectious  diseases in children and adolescents. First, children and adolescents were at  risk of wound infections from medical trauma sustained during bombardment and  other acts of war. Second, young people were at risk of sexually transmitted  infections resulting from sexual assault perpetrated by invading Russian military  personnel on youth trapped in occupied territories or from sexual assault  perpetrated on vulnerable youth attempting to migrate to safety.

STUDY DESIGN: Following enrollment into the 2018  American Board of Pediatrics Maintenance of Certification program, general  pediatricians and subspecialists received a voluntary, online survey with  questions about their experience and self-reported comfort caring for immigrant,  refugee, and internationally traveling children and previous international  experiences. Using multivariable logistic regression, we examined how previous  international experiences, and other personal characteristics, were associated  with self-reported comfort. RESULTS: A total of 5461 eligible participants  completed the survey; 76.3%, (n = 4168) reported caring for immigrant children,  35.8% (n = 1957) cared for refugee children, and 79.8% (n = 4358) cared for  children traveling internationally.

PARTICIPANTS:  1335 women (685 consecutively enrolled from refugee backgrounds and 650 randomly  selected Australian-born) recruited during pregnancy from three public antenatal  clinics in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia. The mean age was 29.7 years among  women from refugee backgrounds and 29.0 years among women born in the host  nation. Main measures include IPV, mood, panic, post-traumatic stress disorder,  disability and living difficulties. FINDINGS TO DATE: Prevalence of IPV at all  three time points is significantly higher for refugee-background women. The trend  data showed that reported IPV rates among Australian-born women increased from  25.8% at time 1 to 30.1% at time 3, while for refugee-background women this rate  declined from 44.4% at time 1 to 42.6% at time 3.

Refugees  sheltered in Malaysia are a high-risk population but basic health checks upon  their arrival, including tuberculosis screening, are not practised. This study  aimed to identify the prevalence and risk factors of tuberculosis and latent  tuberculosis infection (LTBI) among refugee children in Malaysia. METHODS: A  cross-sectional study was performed in three refugee schools in the Klang Valley,  Malaysia, using tuberculin skin tests or interferon-γ release assays.  Participants who tested positive were sent for further examination with chest  radiography to confirm the tuberculosis diagnosis. RESULTS: From April 2018 to  April 2019, we screened 430 refugee children with a median age of 13.0 years.  Most of the children were born in Myanmar (n=274, 63.7%) and Pakistan (n=60,  14.0%). No children were diagnosed with active tuberculosis but 55 of the  children (12.8%) were diagnosed with LTBI. Children with LTBI were generally  older (OR 3.01, 95% CI 1.71-5.29; p<0.001) than those without LTBI infection.  Sex, history of bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccination and country of birth were not  associated with increased risk of LTBI. CONCLUSION: The relatively high LTBI  burden among refugee children in this study poses an indication of possible LTBI  risk among this population nationwide, and thus would be an important group to  target for preventive therapy.

The patriarchal system that underpins the family structure of the South Sudanese  culture is under significant strain as women and children are becoming aware of  their rights, resulting in friction between men and women, parents and children.  Male elders believed the embracing of freedom by women and children was at the  core of family breakdown, leading to cultural erosion, and was the root of the  problems experienced by the youth.

METHOD: In collaboration with community and student  organizations in a midwestern urban area of the United States, we organized a  higher education pathway program for Congolese refugee youth and community  leaders aspiring to pursue higher education. Seven individuals attended a 1-day  program, with a workshop, campus tour, and meeting with university  administrators, and participated, along with two others, in a life history  calendar interview. This article analyzes the PAR processes and interviews with  participants. RESULTS: In addition to individual-level factors such as limited  knowledge about college, various structural-level factors (i.e., school policies,  procedures) impede education of refugee youth. Our analysis highlights the  community as a source of both support and responsibility for refugee youth.  Results show the need to educate the community about higher education but also  the need to educate the university about refugee education and the community's  pivotal role in doing so. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings offer a three-level  (individual, structural, and community) framework of education pathways for  resettled refugees. A critical analysis of how factors at multiple levels  interact and produce unique challenges and possibilities furthers the field of  refugee studies and also informs more holistic, sustainable policies and programs  for refugee education.

METHODS: The project investigated the prevalence of psychosocial  problems among Iranian and Afghani asylum seeker, refugee and immigrant children  and adolescents, and their caregivers who arrived in Australia from 2010. In  total, n=196 children and adolescents aged 5-18 years, and their primary  caregiver were asked about family visa status, country of origin, level of  education, parent symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (Harvard Trauma  Questionnaire) and child wellbeing (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire). An  additional n=362 Farsi and Dari speaking children, recruited through the Building  a New Life in Australia (BNLA) study, a national comparison sample of families  with permanent refugee visas, were included. FINDINGS: Asylum seeker children and  adolescents displayed significantly more psychosocial problems compared to those  with full refugee protection and immigrant background within the current sample  and when benchmarked against a national sample of Farsi-Dari speaking refugee  children. Higher parental posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms was associated  with poorer child and adolescent psychosocial functioning. This effect was more  marked in families with insecure residency. INTERPRETATION: Insecure visa status  is associated with higher rates of children's mental health problems and a  stronger association with parental PTSD symptoms compared to children with secure  residency. This raises important questions about Australia's restrictive  immigration policies.

Despite  this, refugee youth often are reluctant to seek mental health services.  Psychosocial support services, such as school-based groups, offer one solution to  this barrier to care. We had 2 aims in this study: (1) to describe the  psychosocial needs of resettled Bhutanese refugee students; and (2) to evaluate  the impact of skills-based groups on these students' sense of school belonging  and mental health. METHODS: Bhutanese refugee students in middle school (N = 34)  participated in the 12-week group curriculum (a component of Trauma Systems  Therapy for Refugees) and the associated preevaluation/postevaluation. RESULTS:  Baseline descriptive analyses indicated high levels of mental health symptoms;  approximately, 49% of students met partial or full criteria for posttraumatic  stress disorder. In addition, sense of school belonging was significantly  inversely associated with depressive and posttraumatic stress symptoms at  baseline. Paired sample t tests indicate that students' avoidance symptoms  significantly decreased postintervention.

Sherkole refugee  camp is stratified under high risk for malaria. Knowledge on malaria prevalence  and associated factors among under-five children in Sherkole refugee camp is  lacking. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Institution-based cross-sectional survey was  conducted among under-five children in Sherkole refugee camp from October to  November 2019. Total sample size was 356. Stratified random sampling technique  was employed to select the study participants. Standardized questionnaire was  used to collect data. Care StartTM Malaria Rapid diagnostic test which detect  histidine-rich protein 2 of P. falciparum and plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase of  P. vivax was used to diagnose malaria. Bivariate and multivariable logistic  regression analysis was done to identify factors associated with malaria.  RESULTS: A total of 356 participants were included in this study with response  rate of 97.5%. The prevalence malaria was 3.9% (95% CI = 2.0-6.2). Outdoor stay  at night (AOR = 3.9, 95% CI = 1.14-13.8), stagnant water near to house (AOR =  4.0, 95% CI = 1.14-14.6), and the number of under-five children per household  (AOR = 3.0, 95% CI = 1.03-13.0) were found to increase the odds of getting  malaria.

The World Health Organization (WHO) developed  Problem Management Plus (PM+), a non-specialist-delivered brief psychological  intervention, for individuals who have faced adversity. PM+ comprises  problem-solving, stress management, behavioural activation and strengthening  social support. However, it does not include an emotional processing component,  which is indicated in trauma-exposed populations. OBJECTIVE: This pilot  randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to evaluate the feasibility and  acceptability of PM+, adapted to Syrian, Eritrean and Iraqi refugee youth  residing in the Netherlands, with and without a newly developed Emotional  Processing (EP) Module. METHODS: Refugee youth (N = 90) between 16 and 25 years  of age will be randomized into PM+ with care-as-usual (CAU), (n = 30), PM+ with  Emotional Processing (PM+EP) with CAU (n = 30) or CAU only (n = 30). Inclusion  criteria are self-reported psychological distress (Kessler Psychological Distress  Scale; K10 > 15) and impaired daily functioning (WHO Disability Assessment  Schedule; WHODAS 2.0 > 16). Participants will be assessed at baseline, one-week  post-intervention and three-month follow-up. The main outcome is the feasibility  and acceptability of the adapted PM+ and PM+EP. The secondary outcomes are  self-reported psychological distress, functional impairment, post-traumatic  stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity and diagnosis, social support, and  self-identified problems. The pilot RCT will be succeeded by a process evaluation  including trial participants, participants' significant others, helpers, and  mental health professionals (n = 20) to evaluate their experiences with the PM+  and PM+EP programmes. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: This is the first study that  evaluates the feasibility of PM+ for this age range with an emotional processing  module integrated.

Social acceptance of SGBV is  alarmingly high, including among youth. Refugee populations may be at particular  risk given limited social support and access to health services combined with  increased social and economic pressure and vulnerability. Further research is  needed to understand how norms are embodied and reproduced at individual,  interpersonal and community levels through relationships between partners,  families, peers and community leaders. This study seeks to provide data on  attitudes and norms in communities and across youth social networks in order to  support gender transformative approaches that seek to change harmful social norms  that perpetuate acceptance of SGBV. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study will collect  egocentric data from 960 youth in Jordan (480 men and 480 women) aged between 18  years and 24 years. Individuals will be asked about their perceptions of norms  relating to SGBV in their community as well as their perceptions of the attitudes  held by up to 15 individuals within their social network. Data will also be  collected on the social, economic and demographic variables, refugee status,  experience of depression and anxiety, and social support. We will use multilevel  analysis to examine individual and group-level associations. We will also assess  other network attributes, such as homophily, the role of social engagement,  social learning and social support in the transmission of norms and attitudes.

Half of the  Syrians were children aged ≤18 years. Our study sought to examine undernutrition  and overnutrition among a group of Syrian refugee children who underwent medical  screening by IOM for resettlement. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of  Syrian refugee children aged 6 to 59 months from January 1, 2015 to December 31,  2016. The World Health Organization (WHO) Stata package computed Z-scores based  on available weight and height data. Prevalence estimates of undernutrition  (wasting and stunting) and overnutrition (overweight and obesity) were made using  WHO standards. Multivariate analysis was used to determine the factors associated  with wasting, stunting, and overnutrition, adjusting for age, sex, family size,  and country of health assessment. RESULTS: A total of 14,552 Syrian refugee  children aged 6 to 59 months underwent health assessments in Jordan (43·1%),  Lebanon (38·8%), Turkey (7·0%), Greece (6·7%), Egypt (2·4%), and Iraq (2·1%).  Overall, this group of Syrian refugee children had a low prevalence of wasting (<  5%) and stunting (< 10%), and high prevalence of overweight or obese (10.6%).  Differences were observed in the prevalence of wasting by country of health  assessment. In the multiple regression analysis, the prevalence of stunting and  overnutrition decreased with increasing age, and being male was associated with  overnutrition but not wasting and stunting. CONCLUSIONS: Findings revealed an  overall low prevalence of undernutrition among this group of Syrian children  assessed, although prevalence varied by age group. This low prevalence may  reflect the effectiveness, as well as expose possible gaps, of refugee nutrition  programs or interventions in countries of asylum.

The aim of the present study was to assess the feasibility  of conducting a randomised controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the use of TRT among  URM by investigating key uncertainties relating to recruitment, randomisation,  intervention delivery and data collection. METHODS: A 3-month long non-blinded  internal randomised pilot trial with a parallel-group design assessed the  feasibility of a planned nationwide multi-site RCT. URM with or without granted  asylum were eligible if they were 14 to 20 years old, had arrived in Sweden  within the last 5 years and had screened positive for symptoms of post-traumatic  stress disorder (PTSD). Quantitative data were collected pre- and  post-intervention, and 18 weeks after randomisation. On-site individual  randomisation (1:1) followed directly after pre-intervention assessment.  Participants allocated to the intervention were offered seven weekly group-based  TRT sessions. Quantitative pilot outcomes were analysed using descriptive  statistics. Qualitative information was gathered through on-site observations and  follow-up dialogue with group facilitators. A process for Decision-making after  Pilot and feasibility Trials (ADePT) was used to support systematic  decision-making in moving forward with the trial. RESULTS: Fifteen URM (mean age  17.73 years) with PTSD symptoms were recruited at two sites. Three of the youths  were successfully randomised to either TRT or waitlist control (TRT n = 2,  waitlist n = 1). Fourteen participants were offered TRT for ethical reasons,  despite not being randomised. Six (43%) attended ≥ 4 of the seven sessions.  Seventy-three percent of the participants completed at least two assessments,  with a response rate of 53% at both post-intervention and follow-up. CONCLUSIONS:  The findings demonstrated a need for amendments to the protocol, especially with  regard to the procedures for recruitment and randomisation. Upon refinement of  the study protocol and strategies, an adequately powered RCT was pursued, with  data from this pilot study excluded.

Our study used cross-sectional epidemiological data to test  a theoretical model of these key associations amongst a community sample of  children (n = 162) of West Papuan refugees living in remote town in Papua New  Guinea (PNG), a setting of endemic violence and poverty. Culturally adapted  instruments were used to assess three types of intra-familial factors (adverse  parenting, physical and/or sexual abuse and emotional abuse) and three types of  society-level violence and stressors (exposure to systematic violence, peer  violence, living difficulties). Emotional and behavioural problems were assessed  using the Youth Self-Report Checklist. Path analysis was used to test theoretical  associations. Key findings include direct associations between both family-level  physical and/or sexual abuse (β = .43; p < .001) and adverse parenting (β = .40;  p < .001) with emotional and behavioural problems amongst children. In the  broader social domain, peer violence (β = .29; p < .001) had a direct association  with children's emotional and behavioural problems. Several indirect paths  demonstrated a chain of relationships involving family- and society-level factors  and emotional and behavioural problems in children. Only longitudinal data can  provide further support for veridical causal pathways linking family and social  factors with adverse emotional and behavioural outcomes in offspring of refugees,  thereby supporting mechanisms leading to a transgenerational transmission of  adverse mental health outcomes in refugee populations. Such data would give  further support for a multisectoral approach to dealing with at risk families in  refugee populations, in which attention should focus on supporting parents, and  promoting the protection of children from abuse in the family and in the wider  society.",Jun-21,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,909-920,,6,30,,Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: Germany PMID: 32500279,,,,Abuse; Adolescent; Adverse childhood experiences; Child; Child Behavior/*psychology; Children and adolescent mental health; Cross-Sectional Studies; Emotions/*physiology; Female; Humans; Male; Papua New Guinea; Refugee; Refugees/*psychology; Transgenerational; Violence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bidi Bidi, Uganda's largest refugee settlement, hosts  over 230,000 residents. There is a dearth of evidence-based sexual violence  prevention and post-rape clinical care interventions in low- and middle-income  humanitarian contexts tailored for refugee youth. Graphic medicine refers to  juxtaposing images and narratives, often through using comics, to convey health  promotion messaging. Comics can offer youth-friendly, low-cost, scalable  approaches for sexual violence prevention and care. Yet there is limited  empirical evaluation of comic interventions for sexual violence prevention and  post-rape clinical care. This paper details the study design used to develop and  pilot test a participatory comic intervention focused on sexual violence  prevention through increasing bystander practices, reducing sexual violence  stigma, and increasing post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) knowledge with youth aged  16-24 and healthcare providers in Bidi Bidi. Participants took part in a  single-session peer-facilitated workshop that explored social, sexual, and  psychological dimensions of sexual violence, bystander interventions, and  post-rape clinical care. In the workshop, participants completed a participatory  comic book based on narratives from qualitative data conducted with refugee youth  sexual violence survivors. This pilot study employed a one-group  pre-test/post-test design to assess feasibility outcomes and preliminary evidence  of the intervention's efficacy. Challenges included community lockdowns due to  COVID-19 which resulted in study implementation delays, political instability,  and attrition of participants during follow-up surveys. Lessons learned included  the important role of youth facilitation in youth-centred interventions and the  promise of participatory comics for youth and healthcare provider engagement for  developing solutions and reducing stigma regarding SGBV. The Ngutulu Kagwero  (Agents of change) project produced a contextually and age-tailored comic  intervention that can be implemented in future fully powered randomized  controlled trials to determine effectiveness in advancing sexual violence  prevention and care with youth in humanitarian contexts.",2021-01-01,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1940763,,1,14,,Glob Health Action,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 34402763  PMCID: PMC8381980,,,,*COVID-19; *Rape/prevention & control; *Refugees; *Sex Offenses; Adolescent; Communicable Disease Control; Graphic medicine; Humans; Pilot Projects; post-exposure prophylaxis; refugee; SARS-CoV-2; sexual violence prevention; Uganda; Young Adult,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study investigated educators' views on the health and  wellbeing needs of migrant children in Copenhagen, Denmark, and Malmö, Sweden,  and how schools may address these issues. Methods - We carried out 14  semi-structured interviews with education professionals in both cities and  conducted a thematic analysis inspired by the Street Level Bureaucracies theory.  Results - Most interviewees recognized NAMR pupils had specific migration-related  needs but some expressed being unable to cope with more complex issues due to a  lack of vital health and wellbeing services within schools. Recent policies in  Denmark further devolved migrant education to municipalities; while in Sweden new  policies centralized and standardized procedures.

DESIGN: Literature searches were undertaken in PubMed and EMBASE  for studies on migrant child health in Europe from 1 January 2007 to 8 August  2017. The database searches were complemented by hand searches for peer-reviewed  papers and grey literature reports. RESULTS: The health needs of children on the  move in Europe are highly heterogeneous and depend on the conditions before  travel, during the journey and after arrival in the country of destination.  Although the bulk of the recent evidence from Europe is on communicable diseases,  the major health risks for this group are in the domain of mental health, where  evidence regarding effective interventions is scarce. Health policies across EU  and EES member states vary widely, and children on the move in Europe continue to  face structural, financial, language and cultural barriers in access to care that  affect child healthcare and outcomes.

Refugee children  specifically are often coping with trauma and loss and are at risk for mental  health difficulties. With staggering numbers of people seeking refuge around the  world and 50% being 18 years or younger, research examining the effects of  trauma-focused therapies for refugee children with PTSD is highly needed. Both  Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy and the child  version of Narrative Exposure Therapy (KIDNET) have been used for refugees,  although these treatment methods have not been systematically compared. The aim  of the current study is to investigate the effectiveness of EMDR and KIDNET,  compared to a waitlist control group and with each other, offered to refugee  children. METHODS: A randomized controlled three-arm trial has been designed. The  primary outcome is PTSD diagnosis and symptom severity assessed with the  Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for Children DSM5 (CAPS-CA-5) at baseline (T1),  1 month post-treatment, or after 8 weeks of waiting (T2) and 3 months follow-up  (T3). Additionally, instruments to assess posttraumatic stress symptoms,  behavioral and emotional problems, and quality of life perception in children  aged 8-18 are conducted at T1, T2, and T3. DISCUSSION: This is the first RCT that  examines the effectiveness of EMDR and KIDNET in refugee children aged 8-18 years  specifically, compared to a waitlist control group intended to reduce PTSD  diagnosis and severity of posttraumatic stress symptoms and comorbid complaints  in a growing and challenging population.

Thus, the current study examines adolescents'  decisions and reasoning around the inclusion of Syrian peers in Germany. Using a  hypothetical scenario, we assessed adolescents' (N = 100, M = 13.65 years, SD =  1.93, 51 females, 49 males) peer inclusion decisions and reasoning with attention  to comparing inclusion of a Syrian refugee peer and a German peer. Given the  importance of group norms for adolescents, we assessed not only adolescents' own  inclusion decisions, but also what they would expect their peer group to decide  and what they think their peer group should do. Moreover, adolescents' underlying  reasoning was assessed. The analyses revealed that adolescents thought they would  be more inclusive of a Syrian peer than a German peer and that their peer group  should be more inclusive of a Syrian peer than a German peer. These tendencies  toward including refugees were justified with references to morality as well as  social-conventions. In contrast to their own decisions and to what they think  their peer group should, participants expected their group would be more  inclusive toward a German peer than a Syrian peer. This was mainly justified by  referencing aspects of group functioning and psychological information about the  peers, whereas moral and prosocial reasoning was very rarely used for the  expected group decision. In sum, these findings document that adolescents in  Germany wish to be inclusive regarding refugee peers and that they balance  attention to morality and other domains of social reasoning when thinking about  inclusion decisions while they expect that their peers will not consider morally  relevant information when making these decisions. These findings have important  practical implications as they indicate the importance of interventions that  focus on promoting inclusive peer group norms.",2022,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,855171,,,13,,Front Psychol,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2022 Beißert and Mulvey.,,,,,,Place: Switzerland PMID: 35465497  PMCID: PMC9024241,,,,adolescents; inclusion decisions; reasoning; refugees; social inclusion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Uganda hosts over 1.43 million refugees, and more than 83,000 live in  Kampala, largely in informal settlements. There is limited information about HIV  testing uptake and preferences among urban refugee and displaced youth. HIV  self-testing is a promising method for increasing testing uptake. Further, mobile  health (mHealth) interventions have been effective in increasing HIV testing  uptake and could be particularly useful among youth. OBJECTIVE: This study aims  to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of two HIV self-testing  implementation strategies (HIV self-testing intervention alone and HIV  self-testing combined with an mHealth intervention) in comparison with the HIV  testing standard of care in terms of HIV testing outcomes among refugee/displaced  youth aged 16 to 24 years in Kampala, Uganda. METHODS: A three-arm cluster  randomized controlled trial will be implemented across five informal settlements  grouped into three sites, based on proximity, and randomization will be performed  with a 1:1:1 method. Approximately 450 adolescents (150 per cluster) will be  enrolled and followed for 12 months. Data will be collected at the following  three time points: baseline enrollment, 8 months after enrollment, and 12 months  after enrollment. Primary outcomes (HIV testing frequency, HIV status knowledge,  linkage to confirmatory testing, and linkage to HIV care) and secondary outcomes  (depression, condom use efficacy, consistent condom use, sexual relationship  power, HIV stigma, and adolescent sexual and reproductive health stigma) will be  evaluated. RESULTS: The study has been conducted in accordance with CONSORT  (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) guidelines. The study has received  ethical approval from the University of Toronto (June 14, 2019), Mildmay Uganda  (November 11, 2019), and the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology  (August 3, 2020). The Tushirikiane trial launched in February 2020, recruiting a  total of 452 participants. Data collection was paused for 8 months due to  COVID-19. Data collection for wave 2 resumed in November 2020, and as of December  10, 2020, a total of 295 participants have been followed-up. The third, and  final, wave of data collection will be conducted between February and March 2021.  CONCLUSIONS: This study will contribute to the knowledge of differentiated HIV  testing implementation strategies for urban refugee and displaced youth living in  informal settlements. We will share the findings in peer-reviewed manuscripts and  conference presentations. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04504097;  https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04504097.

Elucidating which factors underlie this variation can help us better understand how to  improve health trajectories. Here we used a case:control study of refugee and  non-refugee youth, differentially exposed to war-related trauma, to investigate  the effects of genetics and psychosocial environment on response to trauma. We  investigated genetic variants in two genes (serotonin transporter, 5-HTT, and  catechol-O-methyltransferase, COMT) that have been implicated in response to  trauma. We collected buccal samples and survey data from 417 Syrian refugee and  306 Jordanian non-refugee youth who were enrolled in a randomized controlled  trial to evaluate a mental health-focused intervention. Measures of lifetime  trauma exposure, resilience, and six mental health and psychosocial stress  outcomes were collected at three time points: baseline, ~13 weeks, and ~48 weeks.  We used multilevel models to identify gene x environment (GxE) interactions and  direct effects of the genetic variants in association with the six outcome  measures over time. We did not identify any interactions with trauma exposure,  but we did identify GxE interactions with both genes and resilience; 1)  individuals with high expression (HE) variants of 5-HTTLPR and high levels of  resilience had the lowest levels of perceived stress and 2) individuals  homozygous for the Val variant of COMT with high levels of resilience showed  stable levels of post-traumatic stress symptoms. We also identified a direct  protective effect of 5-HTTLPR HE homozygotes on perceived insecurity.

The Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention recommends screening of refugee children aged  6 months to 16 years on arrival in the United States and retesting those aged 6  months to 6 years between 3- and 6-months postarrival. METHODS: We analyzed EBLL  prevalence among refugee children aged 6 months to 16 years who received a  domestic refugee medical examination between January 1, 2010 and September 30,  2014. We assessed EBLL prevalence by predeparture examination country and, among  children rescreened 3 to 6 months after initial testing, we assessed EBLL changes  during follow-up screening. RESULTS: Twelve sites provided data on 27 284  children representing nearly 25% of refugee children resettling during the time  period of this analysis. The EBLL prevalence during initial testing was 19.3%.  EBLL was associated with younger age, male sex, and overseas examination country.  Among 1121 children from 5 sites with available follow-up test results, EBLL  prevalence was 22.7%; higher follow-up BLLs were associated with younger age and  predeparture examination country. CONCLUSIONS: EBLL decreased over the time  period of our analysis in this population of refugee children. Refugee children  may be exposed to lead before and after resettlement to the United States.

This study estimates the risk of psychiatric diagnoses in children  of severely traumatized refugees. The unique clinical sample consisted of refugee  parents treated for torture trauma and war trauma, and outcomes were investigated  using population-level data. METHOD: A nationwide register study, following all  children residing in Denmark. The exposure was parental torture trauma and war  trauma, and outcomes were any psychiatric disorder, mood, neurotic, behavioural  and emotional disorders and disorders of psychological development. Children's  hazard of being diagnosed was estimated using Cox proportional hazards  regression. Study participants were followed from the date of birth or  immigration to their 18th birthday. RESULTS: The cohort included 3 346 993  children of which 19 294 were identified as offspring to traumatized refugees.  During the study period, 205 610 children were diagnosed with a psychiatric  disorder. Children with parents from the Middle East and Northern Africa had a  hazard ratio of 0.78 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.84) for those treated for parental trauma  and 0.79 (95% CI: 0.76, 0.81) for those not treated compared with children of  non-traumatized Danish-born parents.

This form of violence has  been found to contribute to children's psychopathology independently of traumatic  experiences related to war, persecution or flight. Little is known, so far, about  the exposure to family violence and its relation to mental health in North Korean  refugee youth affected by political violence. The aim of this study was to  examine the amount of organized and family violence and associated  psychopathology in a sample of North Korean refugee youth living in South Korea  compared to their South Korean peers. METHODS: Sixty-five North Korean refugee  youth and 65 South Korean youth were recruited. Trained researchers conducted the  survey in group meetings of five to ten participants. Using questionnaires  researchers assessed traumatic experiences, family and organized violence, PTSD  symptoms, depressive symptoms and other mental health problems. RESULTS: Higher  rates of violence and trauma, and higher levels of mental health problems were  found in the North Korean sample compared to the South Korean sample. Linear  regression analyses including the various types of trauma as potential predictors  showed that the severity of PTSD and depressive symptoms in the North Korean  sample were associated with the amount of traumatic events and family violence  but not with higher levels of organized violence. CONCLUSIONS: The findings  suggest that in a context of organized violence, abusive experiences by family  members constitute an important problem that is strongly linked to the  psychopathology of adolescents.

The resulting 39 studies were thoroughly reviewed with  reference to what factors aided or hampered the refugee children's disclosure of  their life stories. The main barriers to disclosure were feelings of mistrust and  self-protection from the side of the child and disrespect from the side of the  host community. The facilitators for disclosing life stories were a positive and  respectful attitude of the interviewer, taking time to build trust, using  nonverbal methods, providing agency to the children, and involving trained  interpreters. Social workers, mentors, and guardians should have time to build  trust and to help a young refugee in revealing the life story before the minor is  heard by the migration authorities.

Participants included 587 Turkish middle (n = 372, M (age) = 12.19, SD  = 1.01; 208 girls) and high school (n = 215, M (age) = 14.81, SD = 0.97; 142  girls) students. Participants read a bias-based bullying story with a Syrian  refugee peer targeted by an ingroup Turkish peer. Then, participants rated the  acceptability of bullying and group support of bullying and were presented with a  reasoning question (Why?) after each acceptability question (bullying and group  support of bullying). Reasoning codes included Fairness, Refugee Status/War,  Prejudice and Discrimination, Harm, Prescriptive Norms, Group Functioning, and  Relationship with the Bully. Participants' ingroup and outgroup ToM abilities  (measured using the Strange Stories) were evaluated as predictors of reasoning.  Results documented that middle school students were more likely to attribute  mental states to their ingroup members compared to outgroup members while high  school students' ToM performance did not differ across contexts. Further, the  more unacceptable participants judged bullying to be, the more they reasoned  about the bullying by referencing fairness, refugee status, discrimination, and  harm. Results also documented that ingroup and outgroup ToM were positively  related to attribution to fairness and participants' usage of multiple reasoning  judgments while only outgroup ToM was a significant predictor of reasoning around  refugee status/war, discrimination, and prejudice. The findings provide  implications for intervention programs that tackle intergroup bullying by  examining bystanders' social cognitive skills in a specific context.",2022,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,815639,,,13,,Front Psychol,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2022 Gönültaş and Mulvey.,,,,,,Place: Switzerland PMID: 35432123  PMCID: PMC9005638,,,,bystander judgments; discrimination; fairness; group functioning; ingroup theory of mind; intergroup bullying; outgroup theory of mind; refugee status,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Semi-structured interviews and one semi-structured focus group were  conducted with fathers of refugee background, with young children (0-5 years),  who had settled in Australia. Transcribed interviews were analysed using thematic  analysis, informed by the socioecological model of health. A total of 21 fathers  participated in the study. Risk factors experienced included: prior experiences  of trauma, reduced access to family support in Australia, adjustments in  parenting roles, and the challenges of learning a new language and securing  employment. Fathers drew on a number of sources of strength, including a sense of  joy from fatherhood and support from partners, families, and communities. While  most fathers regularly accompanied their partners and children to healthcare  appointments, they were rarely asked by healthcare professionals about their own  needs.

Refugee youth face double exclusion, as most  wellbeing indices are not youth-specific. We developed a youth wellbeing index  (YWI) for Palestinian refugees in Lebanon (PRL) and Palestinian refugees from  Syria (PRS) living in Lebanon, with the aim of providing a snapshot of youth  wellbeing to inform evidence-based youth-specific development strategies.  METHODS: The YWI was developed and its data generated using information from the  2015 survey of PRL and PRS, which was approved by the American University of  Beirut Institutional Review Board. The wellbeing of PRL (n=3940) and PRS (n=1581)  aged 15-29 was measured using the YWI, which examines five wellbeing dimensions:  educational attainment, health, housing, active education or employment, and  access to information. Scores for each of the five dimensions are scaled to [0,  1], and YWI is their arithmetic mean. The data enable us to look at the YWI by  gender, by camp residence, and by narrower age bands to detect any generational  differences within youth. Findings are reported using sampling weights for  representativeness. FINDINGS: 4 years after displacement (2011-2015), PRS youth  showed lower levels of wellbeing (YWI=0·56, 95% CI 0·55-0·57) than PRL youth  (YWI=0·65, 95% CI 0·64-0·67). Although money-metric poverty was significantly  higher inside than outside camps for both PRL youth (inside camps, 75·00%, 95% CI  71·55-78·15; outside camps, 61·98%, 55·26-68·27) and PRS youth (inside camps,  93·89%, 90·56-96·1; ; outside camps, 88·72%, 85·35-91·39), there was no such  disparity in the YWI for PRL youth (inside camps, YWI=0·65, 95% CI 0·63-0·66;  outside camps, 0·66, 0·62-0·69) or PRS youth (inside camps, 0·55, 0·54-0·56;  outside camps, 0·57, 0·54-0·59). Young male refugees had significantly higher YWI  (PRL, 0·66, 95% CI 0·65-0·68; PRS, 0·57, 0·56-0·59) than young female refugees  (PRL, 0·64, 0·62-0·66; PRS, 0·55, 0·53-0·56). Young female PRL and PRS scored  significantly higher for education (PRL, YWI=0·60; PRS, 0·61) than young male  refugees from these populations (PRL, 0·48; PRS, 0·47), but significantly lower  on active education or employment (PRL, 0·45; PRS, 0·18) than the young male  refugees (PRL, 0·72; PRS, 0·47). Older PRS scored higher on the YWI education  dimension (20-24 years age group, 0·61; 25-29 years age group, 0·50) than their  PRL peers (20-24 years age group, 0·53; 25-29 years age group, 0·45), but the  reverse was true for the 15-19 years age group (PRL, 0·60; PRS, 0·53).  INTERPRETATION: Residence inside versus outside camps showed no significant  differences in wellbeing based on the YWI, whereas money-metric poverty was  higher inside camps, which suggests a need to move beyond assistance policies  based on money-metric measures alone. The female edge in educational attainment  is reversed when considering active education or employment, signalling the need  for gender-specific strategies for the school-to-work transition for both PRL and  PRS. The reversal of the educational edge of PRS over PRL in the 15-19 years age  group is another concerning indicator of the cost of conflict for PRS that  persists even four years after their displacement.

We sought to determine the  prevalence and factors associated with thinness among children aged 5-17 years  living in Nakivale refugee settlement, Isingiro district, southwestern Uganda.  METHODS: This was a cross sectional study that enrolled 420 children aged 5 to 17  years. The World Health Organization cluster sampling was used to select 30  villages from which 14 households were selected by consecutive sampling and  participants were then chosen per household by simple random sampling. Data were  collected on the participant socio-demographic, family, dietary, medical, hygiene  and refugee status factors. Thinness was defined as having a z-score < -2  standard deviations of Body Mass Index-for-age from the median WHO growth  standards. The prevalence of thinness was determined by ascertaining the total  number of children with thinness over the total number of children studied.  Multivariable logistic regression model was used to determine the factors  independently associated with thinness with p < 0.05 level of significance.  RESULTS: A total of 420 children aged 5-17 years were enrolled into the study.  The median age (IQR) was 8.6 (6.8-11.8) and majority 248 (59.1%) were female. The  prevalence of thinness was 5.5% (95% CI: 3.7-8.1%). The factors independently  associated with thinness were; living with a chronic disease (aOR 6.47, 95%CI;  1.63-24.64, p = 0.008), use of water from natural sources (aOR 3.32, 95%CI;  1.27-8.71, p = 0.015), and duration of stay in the settlement of less or equal to  10 years (aOR 3.19, 95%CI; 1.15-8.83, p = 0.025). CONCLUSION: Five in every 100  children aged 5-17 years in Nakivale refugee settlement have thinness. Thinness  was more likely among children who are living with a chronic disease, used water  from natural sources and those whose families had stayed shorter in the  settlement.

We aimed to investigate the  proportion of Syrian refugee children who can be considered resilient, and  applied a novel approach to identify factors predicting individual differences in  mental health outcomes following war exposure. METHODS: The sample included 1,528  war-exposed Syrian refugee children and their primary caregiver living in refugee  settlements in Lebanon. Children were classed as having low symptoms (LS) if they  scored below clinically validated cut-offs for post-traumatic stress disorder  (PTSD), depression and externalising behaviour problems. Children scoring above  any cut-off were classified as having high symptoms (HS). Each LS child was  matched with one HS who reported similar war exposure, to test what  differentiates children with similar exposures but different outcomes. RESULTS:  19.3% of the children met our resilience criteria and were considered LS. At the  individual level, protective traits (e.g. self-esteem; OR = 1.51, 95% CI [1.25,  1.81]) predicted LS classification, while environmental sensitivity (OR = 0.69,  95% CI [0.59, 0.82]), poorer general health (OR = 0.71, 95% CI [0.58, 0.87]) and  specific coping strategies (e.g. avoidance; OR = 0.90, 95% CI [0.85, 0.96])  predicted HS classification.

METHODS: The results  of the official hearing test, which was conducted by the Ministry of Health of  the Republic of Turkey for schoolchildren in the first grade in the 2017-2018  academic year in the Province of Şanlıurfa, were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of  23,664 children were screened; 20,603 (87.1%) were Turkish native, and 3,061  (12.9%) were Syrian refugees. The age range was between 69 and 84 months. The  screening results indicated in Turkish children, sensorineural hearing loss  (SNHL) in 0.26%, otitis media with effusion (OME) in 0.41%, and chronic otitis  media (COM) in 0.08%. In the refugee children, the frequency of SNHL was 1.11%,  OME was 0.94%, and COM was 0.62%. The rate of COM and SNHL was significantly  higher in the refugee children (p < 0.001). Moreover, among those with hearing  loss, the frequency of low birth weight, inflammatory diseases, and the family  history of consanguineous marriage was significantly higher in refugee children  compared to those in Turkish native population (p = 0.018, p = 0.003, and  p = 0.022, respectively). CONCLUSION: Hearing loss is a major preventable and  treatable cause of developmental disorder in childhood. When untreated, hearing  loss may delay speaking and prevent socio-emotional development, leading to  longterm negative consequences. We believe that programs for hearing screening in  schoolchildren should be expanded and that immigrants who carry several risk  factors for developmental hearing loss should be included in these programs.",Jul-20,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,110041,,,134,,Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

MethodsIn this case study, focus groups were conducted with 46 Syrian-born  children with a refugee background, ranging between the ages of 8 to 17 years  old. All participants have a temporary residence permit and live in Rotterdam  together with (part of) their family. A board game was developed as a research  tool to stimulate children to share their perspectives on their friends and  experiences with inclusion and exclusion. ResultsAn important finding is that all  of the children have friends in the Netherlands. The majority of their friends  have an Arab background, and different reasons for this composition are  discussed. Furthermore, although all of the children expressed that they feel  welcome in Dutch society, they had also encountered exclusion, which generates  emotional responses. ConclusionUsing a theoretical boundary perspective, we show  that children are involuntarily subjected to symbolic boundary drawing by others,  while taking part in boundary work themselves too.

METHOD: Data on  childhood adversities and sensitivity was collected from 549 Syrian refugee  children in Lebanon. PTSD symptoms were assessed using the PTSD Reaction Index.  RESULTS: Although childhood adversities, war events and sensitivity were all  significantly related to PTSD in bivariate analyses, multivariate analyses showed  that childhood adversities were the most important variable in predicting PTSD.  The effect of war on PTSD was found to be dependent on the interplay between  childhood adversities and sensitivity, and was most prominent in highly sensitive  children with lower levels of adversities; in sensitive children experiencing  high levels of adversities, the effects of war exposure on PTSD were less  pronounced. CONCLUSIONS: When considering the effects of war on PTSD in refugee  children, it is important to take account of the presence of other adversities as  well as of children's sensitivity.

Refugee children have unique service needs and  differ from their non-refugee peers in terms of sociocultural trauma, language,  culture, and educational barriers. This article explains the complexities  associated with understanding refugee youth and presents a proposal for studying  the possible benefits of Tree of Life therapy. At the present time, Tree of Life  therapy has no evidence-base because the published studies of Tree of Life with  refugee and/or immigrant youth have sample sizes of one, six, eight, and  twenty-nine. As a culturally-grounded, strength-based group counseling approach,  Tree of Life therapy addresses traumatic experiences, recognizes participants'  cultural differences, highlights individual skills, and aids in instilling both  confidence and hope for the future. Ncazelo Ncube, the co-founder and main  developer of Tree of Life, describes this therapy as a collective narrative  practice that considers cultural beliefs and values (2006, 2010, 2018, 2019). The  proposed research design is to study the effectiveness of the Tree of Life in  Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and South Africa. The research  plan is to use pragmatic, group-randomized controlled trials in the ""real world""  settings of schools and agencies in each of the four countries. In addition, the  article describes the development of the Roots and Wings Questionnaire for  Children and Youth, a culturally relevant, child-friendly questionnaire.

These groups experience socio-environmental stressors that can  harm mental health. Informed by a social contextual framework, this study  explored the prevalence of depression among urban refugee and displaced youth in  Kampala, Uganda and associations with symbolic (violence), relational (social  support), and material (food and community insecurity) contexts. METHODS: We  implemented a cross-sectional survey with refugee and displaced adolescent girls  and young women and adolescent boys and young men aged 16-24 living in Kampala's  informal settlements. We conducted peer-driven recruitment, whereby peer  navigators shared study information with their networks and in turn participants  were invited to recruit their peers. We conducted gender disaggregated analyses,  including stepwise multiple regression to examine factors associated with  depression. We then conducted structural equation modeling (SEM) using weighted  least squares estimation to examine direct paths from violence, food insecurity,  and community insecurity to depression, and indirect effects through social  support. RESULTS: Among participants (n = 445), young women (n = 333) reported  significantly higher depression symptoms than young men (n = 112), including any  symptoms (73.9% vs. 49.1%, p < 0.0001), mild to moderate symptoms (60.4% vs.  45.5%, p = 0.008), and severe symptoms (13.5% vs 3.6%, p = 0.002). SEM results  among young women indicate that the latent violence factor (lifetime sexual and  physical violence) had direct effects on depression and social support, but  social support did not mediate the path from violence to depression. The model  fit the data well: χ2(3) = 9.82, p = 0.020; RMSEA = 0.08, 90% CI [0.03, 0.14],  CFI = 0.96). Among young men, SEM findings indicate that food insecurity had  direct effects on social support, and an indirect effect on depression through  the mediating role of social support.

DESIGN: A qualitative approach using  semi-structured interviews supported by photo-elicitation. METHODS: Parents of  2-12 years old children who had relocated to the UK within the past three or more  years were recruited from two refugee organisations in the UK. Semi-structured  face-to-face interviews and photo-elicitation were used to stimulate face-to-face  in-depth discussions with participants.

Refugee children have been recognized  as an at-risk population because they may have an increased burden of physical  and mental health conditions, and their caretakers may experience barriers in  gaining access to the Dutch health care system. The aim of the study was to gain  insight into the barriers in the health care for refugee children perceived by  pediatricians by analyzing logistical problems reported through the Dutch  Pediatric Surveillance Unit, an online system where pediatricians can report  predefined conditions. Pediatricians reported 68 cases of barriers in health care  ranging from mild to severe impact on the health outcome of refugee children,  reported from November 2015 till January 2017. Frequent relocation of children  between asylum seeker centers was mentioned in 28 of the reports on lack of  continuity of care. Unknown medical history (21/68) and poor handoffs of medical  records resulting in poor communication between health professionals (17/68)  contributed to barriers to provide good medical care for refugee children, as did  poor health literacy (17/68) and cultural differences (5/68). CONCLUSION:  Frequent relocations and the unknown medical history were reported most  frequently as barriers impacting the delivery of health care to refugee children.  To overcome these barriers, the Committee of International Child Health of the  Dutch Society of Pediatrics recommends stopping the frequent relocations,  improving medical assessment upon entry in the Netherlands, improving handoff of  medical records, and improving the health literacy of refugee children and their  families. What is Known: • Pediatricians in the Netherlands are confronted with  high numbers of refugee children • Refugee children represent a population that  is especially at risk due to their increased burden of physical and mental health  conditions What is New: • Refugee children experience barriers in accessing  medical care • To start overcoming these barriers, we recommend that frequent  relocations be stopped, health assessment upon entry in the Netherlands be  improved, medical handoffs be improved, and that the refugees be empowered by  increasing their health literacy.",Jul-18,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,995-1002,,7,177,,Eur J Pediatr,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: Germany PMID: 29675644  PMCID: PMC5997109,,,,*Attitude of Health Personnel; Adolescent; Asylum seekers; Child; Delivery of Health Care/standards/*statistics & numerical data; Health literacy; Health status; Humans; Medical records; Netherlands; Patient Acceptance of Health Care/*statistics & numerical data; Pediatricians/*statistics & numerical data; Quality of Health Care/standards; Refugees/*statistics & numerical data; Relocations; Screening of refugee children; Unaccompanied refugee minor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most vulnerable are children, who face interruption of schooling  and child labor. This study explored the relationship between social capital and  the physical health and emotional well-being of Syrian refugee working children  in rural areas of Lebanon. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this cross-sectional study,  we surveyed 4,090 Syrian refugee children working in the Bekaa Valley of Lebanon  in 2017. Children (8-18 years) gave direct testimony on their living and social  environment in face-to-face interviews. Logistic regressions assessed the  association of social capital and social cohesion with the health and emotional  well-being of Syrian refugee working children; specifically, poor self-rated  health, reporting a health problem, engaging in risky health behavior, feeling  lonely, feeling optimistic, and being satisfied with life. Of the 4,090 working  children in the study, 11% reported poor health, 16% reported having a health  problem, and 13% were engaged in risky behaviors. The majority (67.5%) reported  feeling lonely, while around 53% were optimistic and 59% were satisfied with  life. The study findings suggest that positive social capital constructs were  associated with better health. Lower levels of social cohesion (e.g., not  spending time with friends) were significantly associated with poor self-rated  health, reporting a physical health problem, and feeling more lonely ([adjusted  odds ratio (AOR), 2.4; CI 1.76-3.36, p < 0.001], [AOR, 1.9; CI 1.44-2.55, p <  0.001], and [AOR, 0.5; CI 0.38-0.76, p < 0.001], respectively). Higher levels of  social support (e.g., having good social relations), family social capital (e.g.,  discussing personal issues with parents), and neighborhood attachment (e.g.,  having a close friend) were all significantly associated with being more  optimistic ([AOR, 1.5; CI 1.2-1.75, p < 0.001], [AOR, 1.3; CI 1.11-1.52, p <  0.001], and [AOR, 1.9; CI 1.58-2.29, p < 0.001], respectively) and more satisfied  with life ([AOR, 1.3; CI 1.01-1.54, p = 0.04], [AOR, 1.2; CI 1.01-1.4, p = 0.04],  and [AOR, 1.3; CI 1.08-1.6, p = 0.006], respectively). The main limitations of  this study were its cross-sectional design, as well as other design issues (using  self-reported health measures, using a questionnaire that was not subject to a  validation study, and giving equal weighting to all the components of the health  and emotional well-being indicators). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the  association between social capital, social cohesion, and refugee working  children's physical and emotional health. In spite of the poor living and working  conditions that Syrian refugee children experience, having a close-knit network  of family and friends was associated with better health. Interventions that  consider social capital dimensions might contribute to improving the health of  Syrian refugee children in informal tented settlements (ITSs).",Sep-20,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,e1003283,,9,17,,PLoS Med,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 32877401  PMCID: PMC7467280,,,,Adolescent; Child; Child Labor; Cross-Sectional Studies; Emotions; Female; Humans; Lebanon/ethnology; Male; Odds Ratio; Quality of Life/*psychology; Refugees/*psychology; Social Capital; Social Environment; Social Support; Syria,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More than 50%  of refugee youth with exposure to civilian war trauma and forced migration  experience high anxiety; up to 30% screen positive for posttraumatic stress  disorder (PTSD).(2,3) Trauma exposure during critical developmental periods can  have detrimental social, educational, and physical consequences. Current  evidence-based therapeutics have primarily been researched in adults; child  anxiety disorders are undertreated and underresearched.(4,5) Psychotherapy for  refugee and other highly vulnerable populations may be limited by high cost and  scarcity of skilled trauma specialists; culturally informed and language-capable  clinicians who can meet the needs of refugee populations are even more rare.  Furthermore, pharmacotherapy is limited by a sparse evidence base, parental and  child preferences, and cost-all factors that again are more prevalent in refugee  populations. Overall, evidence for treatment of PTSD and anxiety in refugee  children is limited and largely extrapolated from treatment for children with  other types of trauma exposure. Dance/movement therapy (DMT) is a manualized,  multimodal intervention that aims to strengthen emotional, cognitive, physical,  and social integration. DMT sessions are led by a licensed dance/movement  therapist with joint education in counseling.(6) Owing to its integration of  exposure, mindfulness, and somatic components, DMT may be a candidate for a  multifaceted, multitarget treatment approach to trauma and stress addressing  psychological and somatic symptoms, both of which can be present in  trauma-related conditions. However, evidence of use of DMT to help traumatized  children is lacking.

The most common  mental-health problems in ASC include posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS),  internalizing symptoms such as depression and anxiety, and externalizing  behaviour. Being an unaccompanied refugee minor (URM) was found to be highly  predictive for higher levels of psychological distress within ASC. Nevertheless,  and even though Germany is Europe's biggest host country for ASC, studies that  reliably examine the mental health of both URM and accompanied refugee minors  (ARM) in Germany with psychometrically tested measures are still lacking.  METHODS: A cross-sectional survey in 19 facilities for minor refugees in Bavaria,  Germany, screening for PTSS, depression, anxiety, externalizing behaviour, and  post-migration factors was conducted. Participants were 98 ASC (URM, n = 68; ARM,  n = 30) primarily from Afghanistan, Syria, and Eritrea. In 35.7% of interviews,  interpreters were involved. RESULTS: Both URM and ARM reported high levels of  psychological distress and large numbers of potentially traumatic events, with  64.7% of URM and 36.7% of ARM scoring above the clinical cut-off for PTSS, 42.6%  of URM and 30% of ARM for depression, and 38.2% of URM and 23.3% of ARM for  anxiety. The total number of traumatic experiences was found to be the most  robust predictor for PTSS, depression, and anxiety. Lower levels of individual  resources, lower levels of social support in the host country, and poorer German  language proficiency were associated with higher levels of psychological distress  within both groups. URM reported significantly more traumatic events than ARM.  CONCLUSIONS: ASC in Germany are severely distressed and burdened by the  experiences of various types of potentially traumatic events. The levels of  distress found in the current study correspond with rates that have been reported  in previous studies with ASC throughout Europe.

It questions the tendency in  previous research to regard the political economy of refugee protection as a  parallel issue to a range of factors affecting children's health. Methods: Based  on ethnographic research with 19 undocumented refugee children in Sweden, the  paper illustrates ways in which the deportation regime conditions participants'  health. Results: Findings show that children lived with precarious status for the  better part of their childhoods, alternating between undocumented and asylum  seeking statuses. Participants accessed formal rights to education and health  through complete or relative strangers at risk of exposure to authorities. The  paper argues that conceptualisations of refugee children's suffering in terms of  risk and protective factors are redundant in this context. Moreover,  deportability, protracted refugee situations and deprived material conditions are  not unique to undocumented refugees, but characterise most refugee children's  lives in welfare states today.

There is strong evidence on the prevalence and complexity of these  children's mental health problems and broader needs. AIMS: To review the research  literature on risk and protective factors, and associated mental health  interventions for refugee children. METHODS: Peer-reviewed studies were included  for the period 2004-2017; if they included refugee, asylum-seeking or internally  displaced children under 18 years; and adopted a quantitative design.  Vulnerability and protective factors for refugee children were considered in this  context, followed by the respective types of interventions at pre-, peri- and  postmigration stage, and across high- and low-/middle-income countries.  Eighty-two peer-reviewed studies fulfilled the selection criteria. RESULTS: The  existing body of literature is largely based on identifying risk factors among  children with mental health problems and predominantly designing trauma-focused  interventions to reduce their symptomatic distress. Recent research and services  have gradually shifted to a broader and dynamic resilience-building approach  based on ecological theory, that is at child, family, school, community and  societal level. There is increasing evidence for the implementation and  effectiveness of multimodal interventions targeting all these levels, despite the  methodological constraints in their evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: In high-income  countries, child mental health services need to collaborate with all agencies in  contact with refugee children, establish joint care pathways, and integrate  trauma-focused interventions with family and community approaches. In low- and  middle-income countries, where specialist resources are sparse,  resilience-building should aim at maximising and upskilling existing capacity.

The aim was to investigate the relationship between  perceived parenting styles and attachment relationships and child mental health,  as reported by 322 Syrian refugee minors aged between 8 and 17 years in Turkey.  Child-rated scales included the Children Revised Impact of Event Scale-8  (CRIES-8), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), Security Scale and  Egna Minnen Betraffande Uppfostran for Children (EMBU-C), and were used as  measures of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), general mental health  problems, attachment relationships and perceived parenting styles, respectively.  Children with secure maternal and paternal attachment perceived their parents as  less rejecting, while children with secure paternal attachment also reported  their parents as emotionally warmer.

METHODS: This  cross-sectional study included children (aged <18 years) undergoing GHA from 2017  to 2019 at a university hospital Section of Immigrant Medicine. GHA was offered  to all refugees newly resettled in the Municipality of Copenhagen. It comprised  of a structured questionnaire, clinical examination, blood test and  recommendations.

In the present study,  our aim was to assess child morbidity and overall disease burden in two camps in  northern Greece during a six-month winter period. A primary health care office  was founded in each camp. Refugees of all ages with health problems were examined  daily by specialty doctors. Cases were classified into two categories: Infectious  or non-infectious. In total, 2631 patients were examined during this period (out  of the 3760 refugees hosted). Of these patients, 9.8% were infants, 12.7% were  toddlers, and 13.4% were children. Most of the visits for children aged less than  12 years old were due to infectious diseases (80.8%). The most common sites of  communicable diseases among children were the respiratory tract (66.8%), the skin  (23.2%), and the urinary (3.2%) and gastrointestinal tracts (6.2%).  Non-communicable diseases were mostly due to gastrointestinal (20.2%),  respiratory (18.2%), surgical (13.1%), and allergic (10.3%) disorders. Infants,  toddlers, and children suffered more frequently from respiratory infections,  while in adolescents and adults, non-infectious diseases were more common.

Yet, children vaccination registration is done  manually in refugees camps and there is no possibility to send reminders to  parents to come back on time. We aimed to boost the parental registration of  children's vaccination records on a Children Immunization app (CIMA) while also  availing the parents with useful parenting skills under COVID-19-related stress.  METHODS: We incorporated United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)  Parenting Skills under COVID-19 information material, through CIMA in Arabic and  English languages. We recruited 1100 children in February-March 2021, through a  community health promotion dissemination approach. A team of two nurses from the  local population and two volunteers (one trained nurse and one trained social  worker), from the camp, was formed. They promoted the CIMA app at two clinics and  through households visits in Zaatari refugee camp. Qualitative data on  impressions and observations of the interactions with the Zaatari camp community  were also collected. RESULTS: A total of 1100 children, up to 15 months of age,  eligible for vaccination were enrolled in CIMA, whereby the staff explained the  content of the app in terms of vaccination schedule, health promotion materials  for vaccination and parenting skills to their caregivers. During the household  visits, the volunteers identified a total of 70 children that have incomplete  history of vaccination records (n = 42/70 girls, 60%).

Comprehensive programs that combine mental health services with  academic, economic, and socioemotional supports reach more foreign-born children  and improve wellbeing. However, little practical guidance exists regarding how to  best combine these diverse services. METHODS: To identify essential service  components and their organization, we interviewed 92 parents, school staff,  mental health providers, and community agency staff from 5 school-linked mental  health programs designed specifically to serve immigrant and refugee youth.  RESULTS: Foreign-born parents did not distinguish between academic, behavioral,  and emotional help for their children; these western categorizations of  functioning were not meaningful to them. Consequently, programs needed to combine  4 components, organized in a pyramid: family engagement, assistance with basic  needs, assistance with adaptation to a new culture, and emotional and behavioral  supports. Family engagement was the foundation upon which all other services  depended. Assistance with economic and cultural stressors directly promoted  emotional wellbeing and helped parents trust clinical mental health  interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Specific strategies to implement the 4 essential  components include home visits by program staff, a one-stop parent center located  in the school to help with basic needs, working with cultural brokers, and  informed consent procedures that clearly explain recommended care without  requiring immigrant and refugee parents to internalize western conceptualizations  of psychopathology. Future evaluations should assess the cost and effectiveness  of these strategies.

METHODS: We conducted a community-based study with a  peer-recruited cohort of urban refugee youth aged 16-24 years living in Kampala's  informal settlements, and present baseline cross-sectional findings. We conducted  descriptive statistics and logistic regression to examine socio-demographic  (e.g., gender and age), material (e.g., income insecurity and education),  relational (e.g., social support), and symbolic contexts (e.g., HIV-related  stigma and intimate partner violence (IPV]) associated with lifetime HIV testing.  RESULTS: Participants (n = 450) had a mean age of 20.4 years (standard deviation:  2.4 years), most lived in Uganda for 1-5 years (53.2%), and less than half  reported lifetime HIV testing (43.4%).

METHOD: Six databases were searched to identify  English studies presenting original empirical quantitative data (published before  September 2022) testing the efficacy of psychological interventions for children  from refugee and asylum-seeking backgrounds. Quality of studies were assessed  through the Appraisal Tool for Cross-Sectional Studies as well as the Cochrane  Risk of Bias Tool. Relevant data were extracted to facilitate a narrative  synthesis. RESULTS: Seventy-one eligible articles were identified (n > 10,000). A  number of cognitive-behavioral, psychosocial, and trauma-focused interventions  that catered specifically to children and their families were identified. A  synthesis of these results suggest that interventions may assist in the reduction  of various psychopathologies, although the effects were mixed across intervention  types.

We measured C-reactive  protein (CRP), Epstein-Barr virus antibodies (EBV), and hair cortisol  concentration (HCC) at three timepoints (pre/post intervention and 11 month  follow-up), and assessed three main outcomes (psychosocial stress, mental health,  and cognitive function). Using growth mixture models, regressions, and growth  curve models, we identified three distinct trajectories for CRP, two for EBV, and  three for HCC, and examined their associations with age, gender, BMI, poverty,  and trauma. We found associations with BMI for CRP, refugee status for EBV, and  BMI and gender with HCC trajectory. In terms of health outcomes, we found  associations between rising CRP levels and perceived stress (B =  -2.92,  p = .007), and between HCC hypersecretion and insecurity (B = 7.21, p = .017). In  terms of responses to the intervention, we observed no differential impacts by  CRP or EBV trajectories, unlike HCC. These results suggest that commonly-assayed  biomarkers do not associate with health outcomes and respond to targeted  interventions in straightforward ways. Our study is the first to examine multiple  biomarker trajectories in war-affected adolescents, in order to better evaluate  the extent, timing, and malleability of the biological signatures of poverty,  conflict, and forced displacement.",Jul-20,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,207-217,,,87,,Brain Behav Immun,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In this paper, we discussed the potential implications of this  updated protocol on the malnutrition status among children residing in the  Rohingya camps. DESIGN: This paper reviewed relevant literature and authors' own  experience to provide a perspective of the updated protocol for the  classification of malnutrition among the children in the Rohingya camps and its  implication from a broader perspective. SETTING: Rohingya refugee camps,  Bangladesh. PARTICIPANTS: Children aged less than five years residing in the  Rohingya camps. RESULTS: Major adaptation during this COVID-19 was the  discontinuation of using weight-for-height z-score (WHZ) and the use of only mid  upper arm circumference (MUAC) and presence of oedema for admission, follow-up  and discharge of malnourished children in the camps. However, evidence suggests  that use of MUAC only can underestimate the prevalence of malnutrition among the  children in Rohingya camps. These apparently non-malnourished children are devoid  of the rations that they would otherwise receive if classified as malnourished,  making them susceptible to more severe malnutrition. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis  suggests that policymakers should consider using the original protocol of using  both MUAC and WHZ to classify malnutrition and retain the guided ration size. We  also believe that it would not take an extra effort to adopt the original  guideline as even with MUAC only guideline, certain health measures needed to  adopt during this pandemic.",Mar-22,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,538-542,,3,25,,Public Health Nutr,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 35016741  PMCID: PMC8814473,,,,"*COVID-19/epidemiology; *Malnutrition/diagnosis/epidemiology; Body Weight; Child; Child, Preschool; Humans; Mid upper arm circumference; Moderate acute malnutrition; Pandemics; Refugee Camps; Rohingya; Severe acute malnutrition; Weight-for-height z-score",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As medical communities work to address the disproportionate  effects of COVID-19 on vulnerable populations, it is crucial to include refugees  in the public health response. Language barriers, poor health literacy, and low  socioeconomic status render refugee populations highly susceptible to negative  outcomes from the COVID-19 pandemic. To better understand the refugee experience  with COVID-19, we constructed and administered a survey among refugee populations  in Houston, Texas. Methods: Our 49-question cross-sectional survey was  administered to 44 participants in Arabic, Burmese, Dari, English, Kiswahili,  Nepali, Spanish, or Urdu with the use of refugee resettlement case managers  acting as translators. The survey encompassed three domains, including a general  knowledge assessment of COVID-19, subjective experiences with COVID-19, and risk  communication practices within refugee populations. Results: The majority of  refugees surveyed admitted to worrying about the effects of COVID-19 on their  community (88.6%). The negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic included  financial adversity (65.1%) and significant disruption of children's education  (62.8%). Although 50.0% of participants self-reported proficiency in English,  translation services were used with 75.0% of participants to ensure full  comprehension. Conclusions: The implications of our findings suggest that local  refugee populations require heightened support during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Since 2010, education has been one of the global strategic priorities  of the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), but much of the focus and  resourcing has been on primary education and, to a lesser extent, secondary  education. Recognition of the role of lifelong learning for refugees has been  much slower, only recently entering into prominence in global documents and  policies. For refugees, the hope and desire for education that will enable them  to achieve sustainable and dignified livelihoods has always been a core part of  their realities. Lifelong learning has the potential to provide the bridge  between disrupted schooling and future aspirations of self-reliance and  participation in society. This article situates the emerging agenda for refugee  lifelong learning in a postcolonial and global context. The author begins with a  critical examination of the postcolonial ""logics"" which continue to construct and  frame the study of refugees, before problematising how lifelong learning is  incorporated and conceptualised in global policy. She draws the conclusion that  despite global commitments, the realisation of lifelong learning for refugee  youth and adults is likely remain frustrated for some time by normative  assumptions firmly embedded in the conceptualisation of lifelong learning and the  education frameworks of nation states. However, she argues that the recent global  disruption to education and the inequalities that have been exposed by the  COVID-19 pandemic provide an opportunity to rethink how education is  conceptualised and the importance of providing lifelong learning opportunities to  enable young people and adults to fulfil their aspirations.",2021,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,851-869,,6,67,,Int Rev Educ,,,,,,,,eng,© The Author(s) 2021.,,,,,,Place: Netherlands PMID: 34776530  PMCID: PMC8576790,,,,Lifelong education; Lifelong learning; Postcolonial; Refugee; Refugee education,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A  retrospective cohort study from 2006 to 2015 was conducted that linked  de-identified data from government sources using Statistic NZ's Integrated Data  Infrastructure. VPD-related hospitalisations were compared between three cohorts  of children from birth to 5 years old: foreign-born children who migrated to NZ,  children born in NZ of recent migrant mothers, and a comparator group of children  born in NZ without a recent migration background. VPD-related hospitalisation  rates were higher among NZ-born non-migrant children compared to NZ-born migrant  and foreign-born children for all of the diseases of interest. For instance,  5.21% of NZ-born non-migrant children were hospitalised at least once due to  all-cause gastroenteritis compared to 4.47% of NZ-born migrant children and only  1.13% of foreign-born migrant children. The overall hospitalisation rate for  NZ-born non-migrant children was 3495 hospitalisations per 100,000 person years.  Among children with migrant backgrounds, higher hospitalisation rates were noted  among those of Pacific ethnicity and those with refugee backgrounds.

Childhood mental health problems have long-term negative consequences  and costs both for the individual child and society. The present study aimed to  explore refugee parents' experiences of their children's mental health.  Methodology: A qualitative explorative study was conducted. Data were collected  through semistructured interviews with nine refugee mothers who have been in  Sweden less than 5 years and with at least one child in the ages 8-14 years. Data  were analyzed inductively using thematic network analysis. Results: The global  theme that emerged from the analysis was Navigating the moving landscape of  forced migration, which described the refugee mothers' experiences of the  previous adversity the family went through, the ongoing transition in the new  context, and, lastly, the pathways to promote their children's mental health. Two  organizing themes described mothers' and children's navigation of the forced  migration: Previous adverse events and new suffering and Promoting children's  well-being. Mothers described aggression and frequent conflicts, or refusal to  play or eat, in their children related to living conditions at asylum centres and  social isolation. This improved when children started school and possibilities of  social relations increased. Mothers' own mental health and lack of language  skills could also have a negative impact on the children. To focus on the present  and have hope of the future was helpful to the children. Encouragement and social  support from parents, teachers, and friends promoted children's well-being.  Conclusion: The role of the host country in the promotion of the mental health of  refugee children is emphasized. Interventions aimed to improve peer relations and  reduce discrimination are needed, and these point to the school as a potential  arena for positive change.

Upon their immigration, youth experience challenges that  have the potential to lead to poor health, yet little is known about their  settlement journey. Accordingly, this qualitative study examines the settlement  journey of African immigrant and refugee youth with a focus on how their  experiences were shaped by the social determinants of health. METHODS: We  conducted a total of 70 interviews with 52 immigrant and refugee youth (ages  13-29 years) who had arrived in Canada in the preceding six years. Qualitative  data was analyzed using Frank's dialogical narrative analysis approach (Frank AW,  Practicing Dialogical Narrative Analysis. In: Varieties of Narrative Analysis,  2016). RESULTS: Youth experienced different settlement journeys that are  described in the three narrative typologies of chaos, quest, and restitution. The  chaos narrative of a long road ahead revealed the themes of 'facing challenges'  and 'still the outsider.' The quest narrative of not there yet was represented by  the themes of 'stepping out of your comfort zone' and 'being relentless.' The  theme of 'supportive environments' depicted the restitution narrative of dreams  become a reality. Youth highlighted the impact of social determinants of health  in their settlement. CONCLUSION: Youth experienced different settlement journeys  that were mired in chaos and challenges. However, youth were more likely to  experience restitution when they received social support and found a sense of  belonging. In future, policies and programs that seek to improve immigrant and  refugee youth's settlement experiences need to be multifaceted, offer more  support and promote a sense of belonging.",2018-03-07,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,333,,1,18,,BMC Public Health,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 29514615  PMCID: PMC5842655,,,,*Narration; Adolescent; Adult; Africa/ethnology; Canada; Emigrants and Immigrants/*psychology/statistics & numerical data; Emigration and Immigration; Female; Humans; Immigrant; Male; Qualitative research; Qualitative Research; Refugee; Refugees/*psychology/statistics & numerical data; Settlement; Social determinants of health; Social Determinants of Health; Young Adult; Youth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In  Jordan and the Middle East, SGBV, honor killing, and early marriage are priority  public health and human rights issues that often overlap, and affect a  significant percentage of youth. Jordan is home to a large number of refugees  from across the Middle East, who may be even more vulnerable to these forms of  violence than the local youth. The purpose of this analysis is to 1) synthesize  the existing literature and 2) present the perspectives of key stakeholders to  identify research gaps, programmatic lessons learned, and opportunities for  policy change from an ecological perspective at the individual, community,  health-system, and policy/legal levels. METHODS: This study includes 1) a  systematic literature review of both published and unpublished literature since  2008 and 2) focus group discussions (FGDs) with key stakeholders representing 18  international and local governmental and non-governmental organizations. RESULTS:  The literature review included 27 documents. Stakeholder discussions highlighted  important research and policy gaps. Prevalence estimates of SGBV, honor killing,  and early marriage vary across sources; however, all of them indicate that they  remain important issues for youth in Jordan. Several sources indicate that early  marriage has been increasing in Jordan since the beginning of the war in Syria,  especially among Syrian refugees. Refugee youth are particularly vulnerable to  SGBV and early marriage given the worsening economic situation in Jordan. The  norms, attitudes, and practices that support SGBV in Jordan appear to be  reinforced within families and communities. Despite ongoing programs, SGBV  services are limited, especially for youth, and there is little awareness of  service availability amongst target populations. Laws and policies continue to  offer legal justification for SGBV, honor killing, and early marriage.

We sought to determine trends in EBLLs among refugee  children during an 18-year period and examine relationships between descriptive  characteristics and EBLLs by using 10 µg/dL and 5 µg/dL levels of concern.  METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated refugee health screening data from  Massachusetts for 1998 through 2015 for refugee children aged <7 years. We  performed bivariate and multivariate analyses of variables including sex, age,  region of origin, anemia, intestinal parasites, tuberculosis test results, and  anthropometric measurements and used both 5 µg/dL and 10 µg/dL levels of concern  for EBLLs. RESULTS: Of 3421 eligible refugee children, 3054 (88.2%) were tested.  Using 5 µg/dL and 10 µg/dL levels of concern, 1279 (41.9%) and 241 (7.9%)  children, respectively, had EBLLs.

There  are few published data describing the growth status of children who are refugees  in Europe. METHODS: Refugees with up to 5 completed years of age in four refugee  camps in Northern Greece were invited to participate in growth screening for  clinical purposes. Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), weight for age (WFA),  weight for height (WFH) and height for age (HFA) were measured. The World Health  Organization (WHO) normal ranges and 'WHO Anthro' were used to calculate the  prevalence of high WFH and low WFA, WFH, HFA, or MUAC. RESULTS: In total 177 (27%  of children under 5 years in the four camps) were included. The male-to-female  ratio was 1:1.04. Weight and height data were recorded for 114 children, and MUAC  was recorded for 106 children. Two children (1.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI]  1.0-3.7%) had a MUAC more than 2 standard deviations (2SD) below the WHO mean  value. Ninety-five percent were in the normal range for WFA. Four (3.7%; 95% CI  1.4-9.4%) were underweight (>2SD below the WHO median). Seventeen (16%; 95% CI  9.5-24.9%) had a high WFH, and 4 (3.7%; 95% CI 1.4-9.6%) were 2SD below the WHO  median. Nineteen children (17.4%) had a low HFA, including 3 children under 1  year of age (13% of those under 1 year).

Best practices suggest that main-streaming is the optimal strategy for serving  students with disabilities. This study examines the extent to which mainstreaming  in a refugee camp helps to promote children's prosocial behaviours, taking into  account their emotional and behavioural problems. In Kakuma Refugee Camp, Kenya,  researchers collected data from the parents of children currently enrolled in  special needs education centres (n=65) and from those formerly enrolled at these  facilities who transitioned to mainstream classrooms (n=81). Children in  mainstream schools functioned better in terms of prosocial behaviours, but this  relationship disappeared when factoring in children's emotional and behavioural  difficulties. In the context of a refugee camp, mainstreaming alone is not likely  to help children's psychosocial and educational functioning, which requires  dedicated supports, appropriate facilities and infrastructure, and a dual focus  on disability-specific and disability-inclusive initiatives.",Jan-23,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,99-113,,1,47,,Disasters,,,,,,,,eng,© 2022 The Authors Disasters © 2022 ODI.,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 35293624,,,,*Refugee Camps; *Schools; Child; educational inclusion; forced displacement; Humans; Kenya; mainstreaming; refugee camps; refugees; special needs education,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An  estimated 20% of youth are exposed to trauma, and in refugee populations, up to  54% experience posttraumatic stress. Given the physical and mental health  consequences associated with trauma exposure and subsequent psychopathology,  identifying biomarkers of symptom severity is a top research priority. Objective:  Previous research in adults found that skin conductance responses to trauma  interview predicted current and future PTSS. We extended this method to refugee  youth exposed to civilian war trauma and forced migration, to examine  associations between PTSS and skin conductance in this uniquely vulnerable child  and adolescent population. Methods: 86 refugee youth ages 7-17 years completed a  trauma interview and assessment of self-reported PTSS. The mobile eSense app on a  iPad was used to obtain continuous recordings of skin conductance level (SCL)  during a trauma interview (trauma SCL). Skin conductance response (SCR) was  calculated by subtracting the baseline SCL from the maximum amplitude of the  trauma SCL. Results: SCL during trauma was significantly greater than baseline  SCL, Trauma exposure was significantly associated with SCR to trauma interview,  R(2 )= .084, p = .042. SCR to trauma interview was positively correlated with  reexperiencing (R(2 ) = .127, p = .028), and hyperarousal symptoms (R (2 )= .123,  p = .048). Conclusions: The present study provides evidence for feasibility of  SCR to trauma interview as a candidate biomarker of PTSS in youth. This is the  first study to look at SCR to trauma interview in youth resettled as refugees and  is part of the limited but growing body of research to look at biomarkers in  refugee cohorts more broadly. As the number of forcibly displaced persons surges,  early detection and prevention of trauma-related psychology is becoming more  important than ever.

Traumatic  events during flight may have long-lasting physical and psychological effects on  the refugee children. Therefore, it is important to illuminate the experiences  that refugee families arriving in Sweden have endured during their flight. A  qualitative study was conducted through interviews with fifteen recently arrived  Syrian refugee families. RESULTS: The parents described different reasons as to  why they as families had to escape the war. Some families had lost jobs and loved  ones in the war and did not want their children to die as well. They mentioned  that the journeys varied between 10 and 40 days and were usually filled with  struggles and threats. The escape to Sweden was expressed as an emotionally  trying journey. Many parents talked about the fear and terror the children felt.  Traumatic events during the escape, such as separation from family, death of  family members, sexual violence, kidnapping or extortion may have long-lasting  physical and psychological effects on the refugee children and their families.

Evidence of risk factors in the refugee context is crucial to  successfully prevent malnutrition and its consequences. However, little  information is known about the determinants of wasting in a refugee setting.  Hence, this study was aimed to identify determinants of wasting among South  Sudanese 6- to 59-month-old children in Okugo refugee camp, South-Western  Ethiopia. METHODS: Institutional-based unmatched case-control study was conducted  on 99 acute malnutrition children (cases) and 297 children who are not  malnourished (control) from 6 April to 2 May 2019. The study participant was  selected by systematic random sampling and data on exposure variables were  collected by face-to-face interview using a structured questionnaire. Data were  entered into Epi data version 3.1 and was exported to SPSS version 25 for further  analysis. Descriptive, bivariable, and multivariable analyses were done to  compute summary statistics and to identify determinants of wasting. RESULT: The  mean age of the cases and controls with standard deviation (SD) was 13.8 (±6.9)  and 19.2 (±8.7) months, respectively. Multi-variable analysis revealed that  mothers who were unable to read and write (adjusted odds ratio = 3.26, 95%  confidence interval (1.07-7.93)), fathers only decision-maker to use donations  items in the household (adjusted odds ratio = 3.75, 95% confidence interval  (1.28-10.85)), not used all donated refugee food and non-food items (adjusted  odds ratio = 2.57; 95% confidence interval (1.17-5.66)), the incidence of  diarrhea 2 weeks preceding the survey (adjusted odds ratio = 5.28, 95% confidence  interval (2.31-12.04)), and mother's smoking habit (adjusted odds ratio = 2.98,  95% confidence interval (1.19-7.44)) were significant determinants of wasting.  CONCLUSION: The finding shows that mothers who are unable to read and write,  father only decision-maker, parents' smoking habit, not using all donated refugee  food items, and diarrheal disease were found to be independent determinants of  wasting. Hence, interventions on acute malnutrition which are focused on  empowering women through training and strengthening their control over the  household assets, proper utilization of donated food, and non-food items will  play a paramount role.",2022,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,2.05031E+16,,,10,,SAGE Open Med,,,,,,,,eng,© The Author(s) 2022.,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 35070312  PMCID: PMC8771739,,,,Ethiopia; malnutrition; refugee camp; under-five children; Wasting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A Systematic Review.,Journal of child & adolescent trauma,,1936-1521 1936-153X,10.1007/s40653-021-00370-0,,"In 2019, more than 25.9 million children under 18 were displaced due to unending political conflicts. Trauma Focused-Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) has a  high level of empirical evidence to support its efficacy in processing trauma and  behavioral problems in non-refugee children. Yet, little is known about its  long-term effectiveness in refugee children. This study conducted a systematic  review that assessed the evidence of the effectiveness of TF-CBT in reducing  trauma symptoms among refugee children under 18 years of age. A systematic review  was conducted from peer-reviewed literature databases (12 databases): PsycINFO,  PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (PQDT),  Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, PROSPERO, EBSCOHost, Campbell Collaboration Library of  Systematic Reviews, Social Sciences Index, and grey literature sources published  from 1990 to 2019. The search yielded 1650 articles, and 4 peer reviewed studies  were identified that met inclusion criteria and yielded a sample size of 64  refugee children from 21 different countries. All 4 studies provided evidence  that supported TF-CBT's effectiveness in decreasing trauma symptoms and  sustainment during the follow-up assessment among refugee children participants.  Despite TF-CBT effectiveness for trauma symptoms treatment, there is still  limited evidence to suggest that TF-CBT is effective for all refugee children due  to the pilot nature of the studies, and its underutilization in traumatized  refugee children from different cultural backgrounds. Future studies should  conduct more TF-CBT interventions with diverse refugee children to provide more  empirical support for its effectiveness with that population.

Children are mostly exposed to this disease; numerous studies have investigated the  relationship between child malnutrition and either malaria morbidity or  infection. Few studies demonstrated the interaction between child malnutrition  and specific anti-Plasmodium falciparum immune responses. The purpose of this  study was to investigate the impact of nutritional status and iron on total  anti-Plasmodium falciparum IgG levels in children living in the Gado-Badzéré  refugee camp. We carried out a cross-sectional study during August-November 2017  in the Gado-Badzéré refugee camp in the East region of Cameroon. Children aged  from 6 to 59 months with fever were recruited from the medical center. The data  were recorded using a standardized data collection sheet and were analyzed using  SPSS and WHO Anthro software. The total anti-Pf 3D7 total IgG level was  determined using an ELISA technique while a colorimetric method was used to  measure the total iron level. A total of 83 patients aged 6-59 months were  enrolled in this study. The prevalence of malaria and malnutrition was 47% and  31%, respectively. Acute malnutrition was statistically less recurrent in  noninfected children compared with that in the infected children. The infection  tended to have significant influence on the level of anti-Plasmodium falciparum  antibodies in children. In addition, nutritional status and serum iron levels had  no significant influence on children's anti-Pf IgG T levels. Malaria and  malnutrition remain real public health problems in the Gado-badzéré refugee camp.  Knowledge of the nutritional profile of the population would be of great benefit  in setting up an appropriate health program. We therefore suggest that more  standardized studies be conducted to highlight the effect of nutrition and  micronutrients on immunological status.",2020,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1843780,,,2020,,J Trop Med,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2020 Arnaud Tepa et al.,,,,,,Place: Egypt PMID: 32518565  PMCID: PMC7256721,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is a barrier to  developing effective interventions for social adjustment of traumatized  individuals. The present study addressed this research gap through a cognitive  model. Methods: A total of 604 young adults (aged 18-24; living in Australia)  from different backgrounds (refugee, non-refugee immigrant, and Australian) were  assessed through self-report questionnaires. The data were analyzed through path  analysis and multivariate analysis of variance. Two path analyses were conducted  separately for migrant (including non-refugee and refugee immigrants) and  Australian groups. Results: Analyses indicated that cognitive avoidance and  social problem solving can significantly mediate the relation between trauma and  social adjustment (p < 0.05). The model explaining this process statistically fit  the data (e.g., NFI, TLI, CFI > 0.95). According to the model, reacting to trauma  by cognitive avoidance (i.e., chronic thought suppression and over-general  autobiographical memory) can disturb the cognitive capacities that are required  for social problem solving. Consequently, a lack of effective social problem  solving significantly hinders social adjustment. There were no significant  differences among the Australian, non-refugee immigrant and refugee participants  on the dependent variables. Moreover, the hypothesized links between the  variables was confirmed similarly for both migrant (including refugee and  non-refugee immigrants) and Australian groups. Conclusion: The findings have  important implications for interventions targeting the social adjustment of young  individuals. We assert that overlooking the processes identified in this study,  can hinder the improvement of social adjustment in young adults with a history of  trauma.

The camp was built on the site of a military shooting range. This study  aimed to characterize the soil contaminants and assess the risk of toxic  environmental exposures for children living in Mavrovouni. METHODS: Samples of  surface soil (0-2 cm depth; particle size &lt; 2 mm) from eight locations inside  the camp were compared with two reference samples. Soil samples were microwave  digested using a mixture of nitric and hydrofluoric acids and analyzed for lead  (Pb), antimony (Sb), bismuth (Bi), and other metals using inductively coupled  plasma mass spectrometry. These values were compared with action limits  established by the Norwegian Environment Agency for kindergartens, playgrounds,  and schools. FINDINGS: Five of eight soil samples from inside the camp exceeded  Pb levels of 100 mg/kg, which is currently the maximum acceptable value of Pb in  soil for playgrounds in Norway. Two sites had extreme soil Pb levels of  approximately 8000 mg/kg and 6000 mg/kg. The concen-tration of Sb and Bi in the  surface soil of the firing range area strongly indicated environmental  contamination, most likely from previous military activity and ammunition residue  that has re-mained on the surface soil. Concentrations of arsenic (As), cadmium  (Cd), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) in surface soil were lower than action limits.  DISCUSSION: Extremely high levels of Pb, together with high levels of Sb and Bi,  were identified in soil where children live and play in the Mavrovouni refugee  camp. This is the first independent study of environmental contamination at this  camp and adds to the limited evidence base documenting Pb exposures prior to  migrant and refugee reset-tlement. On top of the multiple existing public health  crises and traumas that these asylum-seeking families face, exposure to toxic  ammunition residues may have profound impacts on children's development and  health for years to come.",2022-08-15,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,16,19,,Int J Environ Res Public Health,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: Switzerland PMID: 36011717  PMCID: PMC9408271,,,,"*Metals, Heavy/analysis; *Soil Pollutants/analysis; Child; Child Health; children’s environmental health; China; developmental toxicity; Environmental Monitoring/methods; environmental toxicants; Greece; Greek islands; health impact assessment; heavy metals; Humans; Kara Tepe; Lead/analysis; Lesbos; migrant health; Refugee Camps; refugee health; Risk Assessment; Soil/chemistry; ΚΥΤ Μόριας; Λέσβος; Μαυροβούνι",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this open trial was to conduct a preliminary  evaluation of You're Not Alone, a rapidly mounted, strengths-based,  community-focused capacity building training initiative for stakeholders  interacting with refugee and immigrant children and families in the Chicago area.  Trainings, based on Trauma-Informed Care (TIC) and psychological first aid  frameworks, adapted education and universal health promotion strategies for  population-specific chronic traumatic stress. Two groups of participants (N =  948), who attended either mandatory (n = 659 educators) or voluntary (n = 289  community stakeholders) trainings, completed surveys at pretraining,  post-training, and 6-week follow-up. Outcome indices included participant  satisfaction, acceptability of training model, and changes in knowledge,  attitudes, and behaviors. Over 90% of participants reported satisfaction and  acceptability of trainings. For educators, hierarchical linear modeling analyses  demonstrated significant increases in trauma knowledge, refugee and  immigrant-specific knowledge, positive attitudes toward TIC over time, and a  decrease in negative attitudes toward immigrants. Over 95% of participants  indicated that they learned and intended to use new strategies to help serve  refugee and immigrant children and families. At follow-up, over 80% of those who  completed the survey had utilized at least one strategy, and over 55% indicated  that they were using resources that they learned about in the training. This  study demonstrates that capacity-building trainings swiftly developed and  disseminated to community stakeholders can produce positive change in knowledge,  attitudes, and practices.

Refugees often face significant  stressors both pre- and post-migration, and hence are at increased risk of poor  mental health and wellbeing. Children and adolescents make up a significant  proportion of refugees globally, and hence mental health supports for these young  people are crucial. Current mental health research often uses pathologized  approaches that focus on trauma, although there is growing literature  highlighting the importance of a sense of belonging and the reduction in  discrimination and social exclusion, emphasizing strengths and agency of  individuals and communities. Resilience is often noted for its positive influence  on mental health and wellbeing; however, research regarding how mechanisms of  resilience function is still developing. This study investigated mental health  and wellbeing of refugee-background Australian youth to better understand the  role and function of resilience. Findings suggest that intersecting social  ecologies, such as those within family, school, or community networks, contribute  to development of identity and a sense of belonging for youth, which together  form a resilient system that provides resources for wellbeing. Adaptations of  school policy and practice can support positive mental health and wellbeing  outcomes by contributing to and developing resilient environments, such as  through building connections to family, improving positive recognition of  cultural identity for individuals and across the whole school community, and  actively working to minimize discrimination.",2022-01-10,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,2,19,,Int J Environ Res Public Health,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: Switzerland PMID: 35055569  PMCID: PMC8775447,,,,*Refugees/psychology; Adolescent; Australia; Child; Humans; mental health; Mental Health; refugee; resettlement; resilience; school; Schools; student; Students/psychology; wellbeing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adolescent Sexual and reproductive health is an  essential component of primary health care. Yet, not every refugee adolescent is  able to access sexual and reproductive health services. METHODS: Using  quantitative data from 356 refugee adolescents and qualitative data (17 in-depth  interviews and nine key informant interviews), we examine refugee adolescent  sexual behaviour in Bidibidi settlement-the largest refugee settlement in Uganda  using a binary logistic regression model. RESULTS: The results show that 25% of  refugee adolescents in Bidibidi refugee settlement had ever had sex. After  controlling for all factors, results show that refugee adolescents aged  16-18 years (OR  =  3.47; 95% CI  =  1.09-10.94), males (OR  =  17.59; 95%  CI  =  4.48-69.07), not in school (OR  =  14.57; 95% CI  =  2.20-96.35) were more  likely to engage in sexual behaviour than their counterparts.

CONCLUSIONS: Results from this  study show that keeping refugee adolescents in school and providing sexual and  reproductive health information are likely to delay refugee adolescents'  engagement in sexual behaviour.

The present research investigates the role of personality in perceived similarity  between ingroup children and refugee outgroup children. A study was conducted  among 9- to 12-year-old children (N = 124) at two elementary schools in the  Netherlands. It was predicted and found that children take into account ethnicity  as well as personality (whether a child is introverted or extraverted) when  judging similarity of ingroup (Dutch) and outgroup (refugee) children.  Furthermore, we predicted and found that greater perceived similarity between  Dutch children and refugee children was associated with more positive attitudes  towards refugee children. Finally, children felt lower levels of anxiety towards  an extraverted compared to an introverted refugee child. Lower anxiety, in turn,  was associated with more positive attitudes towards refugee children. Theoretical  and practical implications are discussed. Statement of contribution What is  already known? McGlothlin et al. (2005, British Journal of Developmental  Psychology, 23, 227) found that similarity ratings are based not only on  ethnicity but also on sports interest. Studies among adults show that  extraversion is negatively related to anxiety and positively to cross-group  friendships. What does this study add? The present study shows that children also  base similarity ratings on the personality trait extraversion. Higher similarity  between self/ingroup and refugee children is related to positive outgroup  attitudes. This study shows that extraverted children feel less anxiety to an  extraverted refugee child. Lower anxiety in children is related to more positive  attitudes to refugee children in general.",Nov-19,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,447-460,,4,37,,Br J Dev Psychol,,,,,,,,eng,© 2019 The Authors.

We reviewed  hospital-wide use of interpreters for low English proficiency in a tertiary  hospital across emergency (ED), outpatient and inpatient presentations. METHODS:  Two cohorts with low English proficiency presenting to Princess Margaret Hospital  were audited. Records of new Refugee Health Service patients (presenting between  January and July 2015) and non-Refugee Health Service low English proficiency  patients (obtained through Language Services bookings) were reviewed to assess  demographic profiles and use of interpreters for any occasion of service over the  following 12 months (for each patient). RESULTS: Data from 188 patients were  reviewed (Refugee Health Service: 119 patients; non-Refugee Health Service: 69  patients; total 1027 occasions of service); all were under 18 years of age. High  socio-economic disadvantage and limited education was noted.

Many resettlement countries have policies in place to  support refugee parents' engagement with their children's school. However, the  impact of these programs lacks systematic evaluation. This study first aimed to  validate self-report measures of parental school engagement developed  specifically for the refugee context, and second, to identify parent  characteristics associated with school engagement, so as to help tailor support  to families most in need. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The report utilises 2016 baseline  data of a cohort study of 233 Arabic-speaking parents (77% response rate) of 10-  to 12-year-old schoolchildren from refugee backgrounds across 5 schools in  Sydney, Australia. Most participants were born in Iraq (81%) or Syria (11%), and  only 25% spoke English well to very well. Participants' mean age was 40 years  old, and 83% were female. Confirmatory factor analyses were run on provisional  item sets identified from a literature review and separate qualitative study. The  findings informed the development of 4 self-report tools assessing parent  engagement with the school and school community, school belonging, and quality of  the relationship with the schools' bilingual cultural broker. Cronbach alpha and  Pearson correlations with an established Teacher-Home Communication subscale  demonstrated adequate reliability (α = 0.67 to 0.80) and construct and convergent  validity of the measures (p < 0.01), respectively. Parent characteristics were  entered into respective least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)  regression analyses. The degree of parents' psychological distress (as measured  by the Kessler10 self-report instrument) and postmigration living difficulties  (PLMDs) were each associated with lower school engagement and belonging, whereas  less time lived in Australia, lower education levels, and an unemployed status  were associated with higher ratings in relationship quality with the schools'  cultural broker. Study limitations include the cross-sectional design and the  modest amount of variance (8% to 22%) accounted for by the regression models.  CONCLUSIONS: The study offers preliminary refugee-specific measures of parental  school engagement. It is expected they will provide a resource for evaluating  efforts to support the integration of refugee families into schools. The findings  support the need for initiatives that identify and support parents with  school-attending children from refugee backgrounds who are experiencing  psychological distress or resettlement stressors.

Our study focused on Bidi Bidi  refugee settlement that hosts more than 230,000 of Uganda's 1.4 million refugees.  We explored contextual factors associated with wellbeing among refugee  adolescents and youth aged 16-24 in Bidi Bidi refugee settlement. METHODS: We  conducted 6 focus groups (n = 3: women, n = 3: men) and 10 individual interviews  with young refugees aged 16-24 living in Bidi Bidi. We used physical distancing  practices in a private outdoor space. Focus groups and individual interviews  explored socio-environmental factors associated with refugee youth wellbeing.  Focus groups were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded by two  investigators using thematic analysis. Analysis was informed by a social  contextual theoretical approach that considers the interplay between material  (resource access), symbolic (cultural norms and values), and relational (social  relationships) contextual factors that can enable or constrain health promotion.  RESULTS: Participants included 58 youth (29 men; 29 women), mean age was 20.9  (range 16-24). Most participants (82.8%, n = 48) were from South Sudan and the  remaining from the Democratic Republic of Congo (17.2% [n = 10]). Participant  narratives revealed the complex interrelationships between material, symbolic and  relational contexts that shaped wellbeing. Resource constraints of poverty, food  insecurity, and unemployment (material contexts) produced stress and increased  sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) targeting adolescent girls and women.  These economic insecurities exacerbated inequitable gender norms (symbolic  contexts) to increase early marriage and transactional sex (relational context)  among adolescent girls and young women. Gendered tasks such as collecting water  and firewood also increased SGBV exposure among girls and young women, and this  was exacerbated by deforestation. Participants reported negative community  impacts (relational context) of COVID-19 that were associated with fear and  panic, alongside increased social isolation due to business, school and church  closures. CONCLUSIONS: Resource scarcity produced pervasive stressors among  refugee adolescents and youth. Findings signal the importance of gender  transformative approaches to SGBV prevention that integrate attention to resource  scarcity. These may be particularly relevant in the COVID-19 pandemic.

A.",An evaluation of a common elements treatment approach for youth in Somali refugee camps.,"Global mental health (Cambridge, England)",,2054-4251,10.1017/gmh.2018.7,,"BACKGROUND: This paper reports on: (1) an evaluation of a common elements treatment approach (CETA) developed for comorbid presentations of depression,  anxiety, traumatic stress, and/or externalizing symptoms among children in three  Somali refugee camps on the Ethiopian/Somali border, and (2) an evaluation of  implementation factors from the perspective of staff, lay providers, and families  who engaged in the intervention. METHODS: This project was conducted in three  refugee camps and utilized locally validated mental health instruments for  internalizing, externalizing, and posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms.  Participants were recruited from either a validity study or from referrals from  social workers within International Rescue Committee Programs. Lay providers  delivered CETA to youth (CETA-Youth) and families, and symptoms were re-assessed  post-treatment. Providers and families responded to a semi-structured interview  to assess implementation factors. RESULTS: Children who participated in the  CETA-Youth open trial reported significant decreases in symptoms of internalizing  (d  =  1.37), externalizing (d  =  0.85), and posttraumatic stress (d  =  1.71),  and improvements in well-being (d  =  0.75). Caregivers also reported significant  decreases in child symptoms. Qualitative results were positive toward the  acceptability and appropriateness of treatment, and its feasibility. CONCLUSIONS:  This project is the first to examine a common elements approach (CETA: defined as  flexible delivery of elements, order, and dosing) with children and caregivers in  a low-resource setting with delivery by lay providers. CETA-Youth may offer an  effective treatment that is easier to implement and scale-up versus multiple  focal interventions.

The limited amount of objective evidence available in  most asylum claims means that the UASC's account of their experiences often  becomes key in deciding whether or not the young person is granted protection.  Research indicates that assumptions about human memory influence decision-makers'  views on asylum seekers' accounts; however, these do not necessarily appear to  fit with the published research on autobiographical memory and may lead to an  unfair decision. Therefore, understanding the nature and limitations of  autobiographical memory is key to a fair refugee determination process. A  literature review of published research on autobiographical memory among  adolescents was undertaken across four databases. In total, 45 papers were  identified which were thematically organised into three areas: development of  autobiographical memory, contextual influences and impact of psychopathology.  From this review, conclusions are drawn about what can be reasonably expected of  an adolescent's autobiographical memory generally and more specifically when the  unique characteristics of UASC are taken into account. We also discusss how  commonly used credibility indicators in refugee status determinations for minors  are problematic in light of this research.

The research data consist of practice-based interviews  with managerial staff from social services and operational staff at homes for  unaccompanied children, as well as manuals and printed routines. The analysis  demonstrates that they coped with the challenges posed by the refugee situation  by adopting competences, mobilising meanings, and adapting material resources  belonging to different practices of everyday work.

BACKGROUND:  Increasingly, more families from a refugee background are resettling in regional  Victoria. The refugee journey has significant effect on families. Refugee  families with infants and young children can be provided with support by maternal  and child health services; however, many families experience barriers to ongoing  engagement with this service. DESIGN: This descriptive study used focus group and  questionnaire. A purposive sample of 26 maternal and child health nurses was  drawn from six municipalities throughout regional Victoria, where higher numbers  of people from a refugee background resettle. Six focus groups were held in 2014.  Audio-recorded narratives were transcribed, prior to inductive thematic analysis.  METHODS: This descriptive study used focus group and questionnaire. A purposive  sample of 26 Maternal and Child Health nurses was drawn from six municipalities  throughout regional Victoria where higher numbers of people from a refugee  background resettle. Six focus groups were held in 2014. Audio-recorded  narratives were transcribed verbatim, prior to inductive thematic analysis.  RESULTS: Participating nurses were experienced nurses, averaging 12 years in the  service. Four major themes emerged from thematic analysis: ""How to identify women  from a refugee background""; ""The Maternal and Child Health nurse role when  working with families from a refugee background""; ""Interpreting issues""; and  ""Access to other referral agencies."" Nurses worked to develop a relationship with  families, attending to a complex mix of issues which were complicated by language  barriers. Nurses found their role in supporting refugee families required  additional time and more home visits. CONCLUSIONS: To provide best practice,  maternal and child health nurses need (i) ongoing professional development; (ii)  time, flexibility and creativity to build relationships with refugee families and  (iii) better access to services that enhance communication, such as interpreting  services and translated resources. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses require  ongoing professional development to help them address the multifaceted needs of  families of refugee background. With limited resources available in regional  areas, accessing further education can be challenging. Distance education models  and organisational support could provide nurses with educational opportunities  aimed at improving service provision and clinical practice.",Sep-18,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,3387-3396,,17-18,27,,J Clin Nurs,,,,,,,,eng,© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 29356230,,,,"*Cultural Competency; Adult; Child; continuing education; Family/psychology; Female; Focus Groups; Health Services Accessibility/*standards; Humans; Infant; maternal child health service; Maternal-Child Health Services/organization & administration; Maternal-Child Nursing/*standards; Middle Aged; nursing and midwifery; Practice Patterns, Nurses'/*standards; refugees and asylum seekers; Refugees/*psychology; Surveys and Questionnaires; Victoria; Young Adult",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adolescent UAM in the United  States (U.S.) are relatively understudied, especially regarding their resilience  and emotional well-being after resettlement. Small school-based studies have  documented the mental health status of UAM who resettled reuniting with their  parents. However, many do not resettle with parents and less is known about the  degree to which post-resettlement household composition impacts resilience and  emotional well-being. METHODS: Our goal was to examine how migration  characteristics, supports, resilience, and emotional well-being vary by UAM  resettlement household composition (reunification with parents, reunification  with a non-parental family member, or living in a household not containing any  family members). Using a mixed-methods (quantitative-qualitative) cross-sectional  approach, we assessed 46 Latin American adolescent UAM to the U.S. who resettled  into these three household types. RESULTS: Youth experienced support differently  by household type, influencing their strategies for adapting and coping  post-resettlement, impacting their resilience (Kruskal Wallis-H 4.8; p<0.09) and  emotional well-being (Kruskal Wallis 5.3; p<0.07). Youth living in households  without relatives (n = 9) had lower resilience (Fisher's exact test p<0.002) and  positive affect (Fisher's exact test p<0.003) and needed to expend greater  efforts to mobilize social supports than youth living with parents (n = 22) or  with non-parental family members (n = 15). CONCLUSION: The needs and coping  abilities of UAM migrants vary with the composition of their immediate receiving  environment, their post-resettlement household.

RESULTS: Forced expulsion from Bhutan was viewed as a violation of core  ethnic-Nepali beliefs and sense of purpose related to collective identity.  Throughout their 30-year refugee life trajectory, participants utilized coping  strategies, including interpersonal support, reappraisal of experiences of trauma  and loss, and helping oneself by helping others, that were informed by, and  strengthened, this collective identity.

Characterizing the clinical  features of malaria in refugees can inform approaches to reduce its burden.  METHODS: The study was conducted in a high-transmission region of northern Zambia  hosting Congolese refugees. We analyzed surveillance data and hospital records of  children with severe malaria from refugee and local sites using multivariable  regression models and geospatial visualization. RESULTS: Malaria prevalence in  the refugee settlement was similar to the highest burden areas in the district,  consistent with the local ecology and leading to frequent rapid diagnostic test  stockouts. We identified 2197 children hospitalized for severe malaria during the  refugee crisis in 2017 and 2018. Refugee children referred from a refugee transit  center (n = 63) experienced similar in-hospital mortality to local children and  presented with less advanced infection. However, refugee children from a  permanent refugee settlement (n = 110) had more than double the mortality of  local children (P < .001), had lower referral rates, and presented more  frequently with advanced infection and malnutrition. Distance from the hospital  was an important mediator of the association between refugee status and mortality  but did not account for all of the increased risk. CONCLUSIONS: Malaria outcomes  were more favorable in refugee children referred from a highly outfitted refugee  transit center than those referred later from a permanent refugee settlement.

Thus, there is a need for interventions that address mental  health problems in these populations. Schools have been identified as an ideal  setting for delivering such interventions as they offer a non-stigmatizing space  and are often central to young refugees' social networks. The RefugeesWellSchool  trial in Sweden will investigate an intervention comprising two programmes:  Teaching Recovery Techniques (TRT) and In-service Teacher Training (INSETT),  delivered in a school setting, among refugee youth. TRT is a group-based  programme for children and adolescents, informed by Trauma-Focused Cognitive  Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT). INSETT is a multi-module course for teachers  providing information on trauma and the refugee experience to build teachers'  cultural competence and capacity for supporting refugee youths in schools.  METHODS: This trial employs a cluster randomized-control design with two arms:  (1) the intervention arm in which the TRT and INSETT programmes are offered (n =  350), (2) the wait-list control arm (n = 350) in which services are provided as  usual until the TRT and INSETT programmes are offered approximately six months  later. Data will be collected prior to the intervention, immediately following  the intervention, and at three months post-intervention. Outcomes for the trial  arms will be compared using linear mixed models or ANCOVA repeated measures as  well as the Reliable Change Index (RCI). DISCUSSION: This study will provide  knowledge about the effectiveness of an intervention comprising two programmes: a  group-based programme for youth reporting symptoms of PTSD and a training course  for teachers, in order to build their competence and ability to support refugee  youths in schools.

The growth and nutritional status of paediatric refugees  following resettlement in developed countries and the related interplay with  socio-economic factors remain less defined; this study aims to describe these  features. METHODS: Standardised dietary, medical and socio-demographic health  assessments of new refugee patients attending a multidisciplinary paediatric  Refugee Health Service (RHS) in Western Australia between 2010 and 2015 were  analysed. RESULTS: Demographic data from 1131 paediatric refugees are described  (age 2 months to 17.8 years). The majority experienced socio-economic  disadvantage, had limited parental education and required interpreters.  Nutritional deficiencies were common but varied across ethnicities: iron  deficiency (ID) (12.3%), anaemia (7.3%) and inadequate dairy intake (41.0%). A  third of children (32.6%) did not consume meat. Infant breastfeeding was  sustained (77.8%) in infants <12 months. Prolonged breastfeeding (44.9% aged  12-24 months) was associated with an increased risk of ID (odds ratio 4.0, 95%  confidence interval 1.4-11.6). Median body mass index increased significantly for  those >24 months between referral and RHS assessment (median period 1.8 months).  Overall, 27.1% required additional formal dietetic follow-up, with higher  nutritional concerns in refugee children <24 months compared to older patients.  CONCLUSIONS: Identification of frequent post-settlement nutritional concerns has  been captured through structured multidisciplinary paediatric health screening.  Specific screening for socio-economic influencing factors, including education,  poverty and food insecurity, during refugee clinical assessments is recommended.  Development of targeted, culturally appropriate parental education resources and  interventions may improve management following resettlement.

Access to  healthcare for this population remains a challenge. The main purpose of this  study was to explore refugee caregivers' perceptions of their children's access  to quality health service delivery to their young children in Durban, South  Africa. METHODS: This study used an explanatory mixed methods design, purposively  sampling 120 and 10 participants for the quantitative and qualitative phases,  respectively. Participants were administered a self-developed questionnaire that  assessed demographic information of participants, socioeconomic status and living  standard, medical history of children, satisfaction and experiences with  healthcare services and refugees' networks and social support. A semi-structured  interview schedule was developed to elicit in-depth and more detailed information  from the participants on the quantitative areas that were investigated.  Frequencies were calculated and a χ(2) test was used to explore the factors  associated with refugees' satisfaction of the healthcare provided and thematic  analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data. RESULTS: The majority (89%) of  caregivers were women, with over 70% of them aged between 30 and 35 years. Over  74% of caregivers visited public clinics for their children's healthcare needs.  The majority of caregivers (95%) were not satisfied with healthcare services  delivery to their children due to the long waiting hours and the negative  attitudes and discriminatory behaviours of healthcare workers, particularly in  public healthcare facilities.

Knowledge gaps are particularly pronounced for urban refugees who experience  poverty, overcrowded living conditions and poor sanitation access that constrain  the ability to practise COVID-19 mitigation strategies such as physical  distancing and frequent hand washing. With over 1.4 million refugees, Uganda is  sub-Saharan Africa's largest refugee hosting nation. More than 90 000 of Uganda's  refugees live in Kampala, most in informal settlements, and 27% are aged 15-24  years old. There is an urgent need for tailored COVID-19 responses with urban  refugee adolescents and youth. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of  an 8-week interactive informational mobile health intervention on COVID-19  prevention practices among refugee and displaced youth aged 16-24 years in  Kampala, Uganda. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a pre-test/post-test study  nested within a larger cluster randomised trial. Approximately 385 youth  participants will be enrolled and followed for 6 months. Data will be collected  at three time points: before the intervention (time 1); immediately after the  intervention (time 2) and at 16-week follow-up (time 3). The primary outcome  (self-efficacy to practise COVID-19 prevention measures) and secondary outcomes  (COVID-19 risk awareness, attitudes, norms and self-regulation practices;  depression; sexual and reproductive health practices; food and water security;  COVID-19 vaccine acceptability) will be evaluated using descriptive statistics  and regression analyses.

While these refugees vary in socioeconomic background, it is notable that 50% of Syrian  refugee children in Turkey display symptoms of post-traumatic stress and that  more than 663,138 of these children between the ages of six and seventeen are not  enrolled in school. For those children who are in school, high levels of trauma  have significant implications for the education system as trauma alters the brain  and affects the way children learn. A Global Voice for Autism is an international  non-governmental relief and development organization that exists to equip  teachers and families in conflict-affected communities. Its intent is to support  the development and success of children with autism and trauma-related behavioral  challenges in their classrooms, home, and communities. The instabilities inherent  in the Syrian refugee experience pose a number of challenges to the  organization's effective implementation of programming. The experiences of  refugees in Turkey are highly gendered. Therefore, a qualitative gender analysis  was conducted to address and better understand the challenges faced when carrying  out these educational interventions. The article examines domestic violence,  sexual violence, and masculinity as gender-driven constructs that influence how  refugees experience trauma. In addition, structural issues in existing support  systems all present significant challenges to Syrian refugee parents that impede  effective program implementation. It is imperative to assess structural issues in  existing support services to address these challenges and to successfully carry  out meaningful and impactful programming. This Brief Report provides a series of  recommendations in order to ameliorate these challenges and increase the efficacy  of educational interventions with Syrian refugee parents of trauma-affected and  vulnerable children in Turkey. It concludes with a call for policy changes that  protect refugees from deportation when accessing support services and a network  of services that do not require residency permits. It calls for increased  integration of parent trauma support in educational intervention trainings and  the creation of safe spaces where mothers and fathers can discuss their own  trauma and challenges in the hope of significantly enhancing program efficacy.",2019-10-07,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,10,6,,Children (Basel),,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: Switzerland PMID: 31591288  PMCID: PMC6826539,,,,educational intervention; gender; refugee; trauma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main structures and discourses of the sports  system are also reflected in physical education (PE) at schools, which can,  therefore, be regarded as an integral part of it. PE can play a significant role  in the sports biographies of young people from refugee backgrounds. It is the  only organizational framework of sports that all children and adolescents  experience, and for many young people from refugee backgrounds it is the first  and sometimes the only context in which they come into contact with sports in the  host country. Consequently, PE teachers have a special opportunity to support  students from refugee backgrounds in discovering their sports-related interests  and to encourage them to deepen these interests outside school. Research suggests  that teachers interact with learners from refugee backgrounds with stereotypical  expectations for how they should behave and act. These expectations are  structured along gender-specific logics, with male persons from refugee  backgrounds often being classified as violent and threatening and female  individuals from refugee backgrounds as fragile and oppressed. Against this  background, through an interview study with 31 PE teachers from schools in  Germany, we investigate teachers' perspectives on young people from refugee  backgrounds. Specifically, we examine which intertwined gendered and racialized  patterns of perception and interpretation become apparent when PE teachers talk  about this group of students. Constructivist, intersectional, and postcolonial  approaches are used to analyze the interviews and answer the research questions.  The analytical screening of the interviews reveals that gendered and racialized  perceptions of threat and vulnerability dominate the teachers' mindsets. Four  main patterns that follow these gendered and racialized thoughts can be detected  in the data material: victimization and vulnerabilization, notions of threat and  impulsivity, claims for assimilation and normalization, and demands for  discipline. These perceptions can influence the developmental opportunities of  students from refugee backgrounds and reduce their participation and involvement  in school sports and out-of-school sports contexts. Based on these results, we  discuss strategies that might support (future) teachers in breaking stereotypes  and overcoming narrow perceptions of young people from refugee backgrounds.",2020,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,539020,,,5,,Front Sociol,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2020 Bartsch and Rulofs.,,,,,,Place: Switzerland PMID: 33869488  PMCID: PMC8022602,,,,gender; forced migration; intersections; interviews; physical education; stereotypes; students from refugee backgrounds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to assess Canadian paediatricians' current  understanding and utilization of the IFHP, and perceived barriers to utilization.  METHODS: A one-time survey was administered via the Canadian Paediatric  Surveillance Program in February 2020. In addition to descriptive statistics,  multinomial logistic regressions were built to examine paediatrician use of the  IFHP, and characteristics associated with registration and use. RESULTS: Of the  2,753 physicians surveyed, there were 1,006 respondents (general paediatricians  and subspecialists). 52.2% of respondents had provided care to IFHP-eligible  patients in the previous 6 months. Of those participants, only 26.4% were  registered IFHP providers, and just 16% could identify 80% or more of  IFHP-covered services. Knowledge of 80% or more of IFHP-covered services was  associated with registration status (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.92; 95%CI 1.09  to 3.37). Among those who knew they were not registered, 70.2% indicated they did  not know they had to register. aOR demonstrated that those with fewer years of  practice had higher odds of not knowing that they had to register (aOR 1.22;  95%CI 1.01 to 1.49). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that IFHP is poorly utilized by  paediatric providers, with low registration rates and poor understanding of  IFHP-covered supplemental services, even among those who have recently provided  care to IFHP-eligible patients.

This study  describes the special characteristics encountered in pediatric surgical inpatient  refugees compared to locally residing patients. METHODS: Hospital records of  minor refugees admitted to our department from 2005 up to and including 2015 were  retrospectively reviewed. Demographic data, diagnoses, comorbidities, body mass  indexes, hemoglobin values, and lengths of stay were extracted and statistically  compared to local patients. RESULTS: A total of 63 refugee children were analyzed  and compared to 24,983 locally residing children. There was no difference in  median body mass index (16.2 vs. 16.3, respectively, p = 0.26). However, refugee  children had significantly lower hemoglobin values (11.95 vs. 12.79 g/dL, p <  0.0001) and were more likely to be colonized with methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus. aureus (8% vs. 0.04%, p < 0.01). Refugees were much more likely  to present with burn injuries (16% versus 3% of admissions, p < 0.001),  esophageal foreign bodies (4% vs. 0.5%, p < 0.001), as well as trauma, except for  closed head injury. CONCLUSION: The cohort of refugee children in this study was  found to be at a particular risk for suffering from burn injuries, trauma,  foreign body aspirations, and anemia.

Resettled families brought several lead-containing items  with them from Afghanistan, including aluminum cookpots. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate  the potential contribution of lead-containing cookpots to elevated BLLs in Afghan  children and determine whether safer alternative cookware is available. METHODS:  We screened 40 aluminum cookpots for lead content using an X-ray fluorescence  (XRF) analyzer and used a leachate method to estimate the amount of lead that  migrates into food. We also tested five stainless steel cookpots to determine  whether they would be safer alternatives. RESULTS: Many aluminum cookpots  contained lead in excess of 100 parts per million (ppm), with a highest detected  concentration of 66,374 ppm. Many also leached sufficient lead under simulated  cooking and storage conditions to exceed recommended dietary limits. One pressure  cooker leached sufficient lead to exceed the childhood limit by 650-fold. In  contrast, stainless steel cookpots leached much lower levels of lead.  SIGNIFICANCE: Aluminum cookpots used by refugee families are likely associated  with elevated BLLs in local Afghan children. However, this investigation revealed  that other U.S. residents, including adults and children, are also at risk of  poisoning by lead and other toxic metals from some imported aluminum cookpots.  IMPACT STATEMENT: Some aluminum cookware brought from Afghanistan by resettled  families as well as cookpots available for purchase in the United States  represent a previously unrecognized source of lead exposure.",May-22,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,451-460,,3,32,,J Expo Sci Environ Epidemiol,,,,,,,,eng,© 2022.

We argue that this motivational discourse generates  information gaps, fueling aspirations that neither prepare youth for  understanding, nor navigating the constraints they will encounter. In response,  we designed a social media platform orienting Kakuma youth to the opportunity  structure, while encouraging them to set realistic goals and plan accordingly.  Designing a resource by, for, and with Kakuma youth, we illustrate that refugees  have the rights and means to access information on which their everyday  well-being and futures depend.

The qualitative method was used with semi-structured  interviews in an accessible sample of 30 abused refugee women, who were  identified by cooperated local community organizations working with the refugee.  Five reasons emerged from the interviews affecting seeking help behaviors for  refugee women: misconceptions about IPV problem; difficulties to access and  approach different care centers; lack of awareness about the negative  consequences of IPV; unaware, negative expectations, negative experiences, and  incorrect thoughts about IPV's services; and psychological and physical health  difficulties.

PTSD and related psychopathology in children can  adversely affect all domains of development and, in particular, interfere with  learning and socialization. When the experience of violent trauma and related  loss is shared with the entire family, resulting impairment and distress may  prevent caregivers from being psychologically available to process their  traumatized children's emotional communication and otherwise meet their  children's developmental needs. When children suffer from PTSD, it may be  impossible to put their experience and related thoughts and feelings into words,  let alone a coherent narrative. The latter difficulty can be even more pronounced  when the child displays dissociative symptoms, possibly signaling a dissociative  subtype of PTSD. Thus, the narrative within the child's play during psychotherapy  becomes all the more important as an indicator of the child's internal world.  This case report is an example both of evaluation and of psychotherapy that is  both psychodynamic and trauma-informed with a 10-year-old Afghani boy who  suffered the violent loss of his father at age of 3 years, leading to his  immigration to Switzerland. This paper addresses the question of how the  psychotherapist can accompany the child through the elaboration of his trauma and  how the therapist can contribute to the co-construction of a coherent narrative  of the child's experience and to the restoration of an intersubjective connection  between the traumatized child and caregiver.",2022,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,940862,,,13,,Front Psychiatry,,,,,,,,eng,"Copyright © 2022 Junod, Sidiropoulou and Schechter.",,,,,,Place: Switzerland PMID: 35935407  PMCID: PMC9354926,,,,dissociation; intersubjectivity; post-traumatic play; post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); psychotherapy; refugee mental health,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Research has found that sport  participation generally provides youth with a protective milieu that is  especially beneficial for the most disadvantaged youth. Accordingly, the current  study examines whether sport participation is related to positive psychosocial  outcomes for resettled adolescent refugees, and if these effects are greater for  those living in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities. METHOD: Data were  from a large, nationally representative cohort of refugees recently resettled in  Australia (Building New Life in Australia study, BNLA). Self-reported social and  emotional well-being was collected from 415 youth who entered the country as  refugees (M(age) = 14.04, SD = 1.99) at three years post settlement were used.  RESULTS: A moderated regression analysis indicated that refugee youth living in  socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods who participated in sports reported  significantly better outcomes compared to those refugee youth in economically  similar neighborhoods who did not participate in sport. In contrast, refugee  youth residing in more socioeconomically advantaged communities had better  developmental outcomes, regardless of sport participation. CONCLUSIONS: Sport  participation is a protective factor for youth with refugee backgrounds.  Community socioeconomic disadvantage moderates this relationship, whereby  stronger effects were observed for adolescents in more disadvantaged communities.  Protecting the most disadvantaged in our society is a human rights imperative,  and the current study indicates that sport participation could contribute to  these efforts among resettled refugee populations.",Dec-20,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,148-152,,,85,,J Adolesc,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2020 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

The present study was  an exploration of dissociative experiences in multitraumatized war-refugee youth.  METHOD: In this study, we used a mixed-method approach by grouping participants  according to a Western-based dissociation measure (the Adolescent Dissociative  Experiences Scale; Armstrong, Putnam, Carlson, Libero, & Smith, 1997), and  conducting qualitative and quantitative analyses of their verbal descriptions of  mental experiences related to dissociation in the aftermath of war and  resettlement. The sample included 40 refugee youth, ages 13 to 21, 19 girls and  21 boys resettled in Sweden because of war and persecution. RESULTS: Severe  trauma-related dissociation was a problem for a considerable subgroup of the  sample. Some dissociative experiences were present in all the sample; others were  restricted to the most dissociative group. The correlates of severe dissociation  included high frequency and severity of emotional dysregulation and intensity,  negative self- and body-perception, depressive mood, and experiences of  detachment. CONCLUSION: Clinicians are urged to be aware of and assess  trauma-related dissociation in war-refugee youth, and consider not only  dissociative phenomena, but also other important processes such as emotional  dysregulation.

METHODS: Newly arrived refugee  children aged 4-15 years were recruited between 2009 and 2013 and assessments  were conducted at two points, at years 2 and 3 postarrival. Social-emotional  well-being was assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ).  Protective factors were assessed by structured interview and the Social  Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS); scores <150 reflect fewer stressful life events  in the previous year. RESULTS: Forty-three eligible refugee children were  recruited. The SDQ was completed by parents in 90% and protective factor data in  80% at years 2 and 3 of follow-up. Protective factors for normal SDQ scores were:  originating from Africa (p=0.01), father present on arrival (p=0.019) and family  SRRS scores <150 at year 2 (p=0.045). The median number of protective factors was  4 (range 1-8). Better SDQ scores were associated with ≥4 protective factors  (p<0.006).

The findings suggest a vicious cycle, wherein an  insecure attachment to a mother suffering from psychopathology may be linked to  children's risk to be maltreated, which may reinforce insecure representations  and perpetuate the pathogenic relational experience. Interventions targeting the  attachment relationship and parental mental health may prevent negative child  outcomes.",Oct-21,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1308-1321,,4,33,,Dev Psychopathol,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 32594965,,,,Humans; Female; Child; Refugee Camps; Parents; *Mental Disorders; Psychopathology; *Child Abuse; Parent-Child Relations; refugee families; attachment; child psychopathology; maltreatment; Object Attachment; parental psychopathology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current Australian guidelines recommend  serological screening for Schistosoma infection in children and adults from  endemic countries. Data on the utility of follow-up serology after treatment is  limited. METHODS: We undertook a retrospective audit of Schistosoma serology in  refugee-background children presenting to a specialist paediatric refugee health  clinic in Melbourne, Australia, between January 2005 and December 2014. Patients  were included with positive Schistosoma serology, documented treatment with  praziquantel; clinical and serological followup data after treatment, and no  return to endemic areas. RESULTS: Fifty-one refugee-background children were  included. Overall, 40/51 (78.4%) children had serology that decreased after  treatment, 25/51 (49.0%) had a greater than twofold decrease and 22/51 (43.1%)  reverted to negative serology. Six (11.8%) children showed an increasing serology  titre and 5/51 (9.8%) had unchanged serology after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This  is the first study describing the changes in Schistosoma serological titres  following treatment in immigrant children in a non-endemic country.

OBJECTIVES: To review published prevalence  rates as well as possible predictors for sleep disturbances in these vulnerable  groups, including pre-migration stress, acculturation, and trauma before, during,  and after migration, integration, and lifestyle in the host country with  implications for predictive, preventive, and personalized medical approach (3PM).  DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases PubMed, PsycInfo, and Web of Knowledge were  searched using (combined) search terms ""migrant,"" ""asylum seeker,"" ""refugee,""  ""sleep disturbances,"" ""sleep disorder,"" ""insomnia,"" and ""sleep wake disorder.""  STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Peer-reviewed studies from 2000 to 2018 reporting  data on prevalence and/or predictors of any measure of sleep disturbance were  included. PARTICIPANTS: Studies on international migrants and refugees, as well  as internally displaced populations, were included. METHODS: We conducted a  systematic review on the topic of sleep disorders in migrant and refugee  populations. Only published articles and reviews in peer-reviewed journals were  included. RESULTS: We analyzed five studies on sleep disorders in migrants, five  studies on adult refugees, and three on refugee children and adolescents.  Prevalence of sleep disorders in migrants and refugees ranges between 39 and 99%.  In migrant workers, stress related to integration and adaptation to the host  society is connected to higher risks of snoring, metabolic diseases, and  insomnia. Sleep disturbances in refugees are predicted by past war experience.  Sleep difficulties in adult and child refugees are strongly correlated to trauma.  Torture of parents and grandparents can predict sleep disorders in refugee  children, while being accompanied by parents to the host country has a protective  effect on children's sleep. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Considering the  differences in risk factors, vulnerability, and traumatic life events for  different migrant populations, origins of sleep difficulties vary, depending on  the migrant populations. Effects on sleep disturbances and sleep quality may be a  result of integration in the host country, including changes of lifestyle, such  as diet and working hours with implication for OSAS (obstructive sleep apnea) and  insomnia. Compared with migrant populations, sleep disturbances in refugee  populations are more correlated with mental health symptoms and disorders,  especially PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder), than with psychosocial  problems. In juvenile refugee populations, psychological problems and disturbed  sleep are associated with traumatic experiences during their journey to the host  country. Findings highlight the need for expert recommendations for development  of 3P approach stratified in the following: (1) prediction, including structured  exploration of predisposing and precipitating factors that may trigger acute  insomnia, screening of the according sleep disorders by validated translated  questionnaires and sleep diaries, and a face-to-face or virtual setting and  screening of OSAS; (2) target prevention by sleep health education for female and  male refugees and migrant workers, including shift workers; and (3) personalized  medical approach, including translated cognitive behavioral treatment for  insomnia (CBT-I) and imagery rehearsal therapy for refugees and telehealth  programs for improved CPAP adherence in migrants, with the goal to enable better  sleep health quality and improved health economy.",Jun-20,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,251-260,,2,11,,EPMA J,,,,,,,,eng,"© European Association for Predictive, Preventive and Personalised Medicine (EPMA) 2020.",,,,,,Place: Switzerland PMID: 32549917  PMCID: PMC7272531,,,,Sleep; Trauma; Refugees; Refugee children; Migrants; Asylum seeker; Prevention; Insomnia; Migrant workers; Personalized approach; Prediction; Sleep disorders; Sleep disturbances,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the wake of the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery, previous  research has focused on defining the burden of surgical conditions among a  pediatric population, however these studies often fail to include forced migrant  or refugees. The goal of this study was to estimate the prevalence of pediatric  surgical conditions among refugees in east Africa. METHODS: We used the  previously validated Surgeons OverSeas Assessment of Surgical Need (SOSAS) that  utilizes cross-sectional design with random cluster sampling to assess prevalence  of surgical disease among participants aged 0 to 18 years in Nyarugusu refugee  camp, Tanzania. We used descriptive and multivariable analyses including an  average marginal effects model. RESULTS: A total of 1,658 participants were  included in the study. The mean age of our sample was 8.3 ± 5.8 years. A total of  841 participants (50.7%) were male and 817 participants (49.3%) were female. A  total of 513 (n = 30.9%) reported a history or presence of a problem that may be  surgical in nature, and 280 (54.6%) of them reported the problem was ongoing or  untreated. Overall, 16.9% had an ongoing problem that may be amenable to surgery.  We found that increasing age and recent illness were associated with having a  surgical problem on both our multivariable analyses. CONCLUSION: To our  knowledge, this is the first and largest study of prevalence of surgical  conditions among refugee children in sub-Saharan Africa. We found that over 16%  (one-in-six) of refugee children have a problem that may be amenable to surgery.

With the increasing number of refugees from HIV endemic countries, it  is important to assess the programs established to support patients upon arrival.  Refugees have been reported to have a lower health literacy and face  disease-related stigmatization, which must be overcome for the lifelong treatment  of HIV. CASE PRESENTATION: 31-year-old female arrived in Canada as a refugee from  Sudan with her 5 children in July of 2017. She was diagnosed with HIV and severe  dental carries during her initial medical evaluation and referred to our centre.  A lack of social support has resulted in severe psychological stress. The first  being stigmatization which has led to her not disclosing the diagnosis to anyone  outside her medical care team. Her level of knowledge about HIV is consistent  with literature reporting that despite HIV prevention programs in refugee camps,  compliance with risk reduction behaviors, especially in females, is low. Lastly,  her major concern relates to the cost of living and supporting her children.  CONCLUSION: Assessment of current HIV programs is necessary to recognize and  resolve gaps in the system. Focusing on programs which increase both risk  reduction behaviors in refugee camps and integration of refugees in a new  healthcare system can facilitate an easier transition for patients and aid in the  quest for global 90-90-90 targets for HIV.",2019,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,61-65,,1,14,,Rev Recent Clin Trials,,,,,,,,eng,"Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.",,,,,,Place: United Arab Emirates PMID: 30179141  PMCID: PMC6691779,,,,Humans; Adult; Female; Risk Assessment; Severity of Illness Index; Disease Management; Canada; Follow-Up Studies; Treatment Outcome; refugee; Social Stigma; Refugees/*education; HIV; AIDS; Black People; Delivery of Health Care/*economics; Early Diagnosis; Endemic Diseases/*statistics & numerical data; global policy; HIV Education; HIV Infections/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/ethnology; Patient Education as Topic/methods; stigma.; Sudan/epidemiology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Ten focus group discussions (FGDs) were held with 87 boys and 79 girls  aged 12-17 years Six FGDs were held with a total of 36 parents and caregivers in  the two camps. Key informant interviews were held with nine local and national  level stakeholders. RESULTS: Study findings centered upon intersectionality.  Camps designed for security and containment introduced new forms of vulnerability  and threats. Economic stressors threatened the viability of families. Girls had  material needs but few options to meet those needs within the camps. Their  families expected them to do domestic work at home. Participants reported that  the convergence of material deprivation, lack of economic opportunity, and  vulnerability led to transactional sex and exploitation within and around the  camps.

METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of all refugee children (<15 years of  age) evaluated for LTBI with both TST and interferon-γ release assay between 2007  and 2010 in the Illawarra-Shoalhaven region of New South Wales, Australia.  Demographics, country of origin, bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination  status, chest X-ray results, TST and QGIT test results, clinical management and  outcome on long-term follow-up were assessed. RESULTS: Of 272 children evaluated,  complete results were available for 212 (78%). The vast majority (207; 98%) were  from Africa or Southeast Asia. Overall, 33 (16%) children were treated for LTBI;  13 (39%) had concordant TST and QGIT results and 20 (61%) discordant results.

Prevalence of PTSD is high among refugees. Refugee  children have been reported to perform poorly in school. The aim of this study  was to investigate the impact of PTSD in refugee and native Swedish parents on  children's school performance and to compare the impact of PTSD with that of  other major psychiatric disorders. Methods: Register study where multiple  regression models were used to analyse school performance in 15-16-year-olds in a  national cohort (n = 703,813). PTSD and other major psychiatric disorders  (bipolar, depression and/or psychotic disorders) were identified from out- and  in-patient hospital care. Results: Maternal and paternal PTSD were associated  with lower grades, with adjusted effects of 0.30-0.37 SD in refugee and 0.46-0.50  SD in native Swedish families. Impact of PTSD was greater than that of other  psychiatric disorders and comorbidity to PTSD did not increase this impact.  Although the impact of PTSD on grades was greater in children in native Swedish  families, consequences with regard to eligibility to secondary education were  greater for children in refugee families, where 35% of these children were  ineligible. Conclusions: Parental PTSD has major consequences for children's  school performance and contributes to the lower school performance in children in  refugee families in Sweden.

OBJECTIVES: This study tested the safety, feasibility, and trial  procedures of the EASE intervention among Syrian refugee youth in preparation for  a definitive randomized controlled trial (RCT). METHODS: A feasibility RCT was  conducted in Amman, Jordan with Syrian children aged 10-14 years who reported  psychological distress. Following community screening, youth and their caregivers  were randomized to receive either the EASE intervention or enhanced treatment as  usual (ETAU). EASE comprised seven group sessions teaching children coping  skills, and caregivers received three group sessions to augment the youth  sessions. Assessments were conducted at baseline and 1 week following the last  EASE session (8 weeks following baseline). Following the trial, a qualitative  process evaluation with staff and beneficiaries took place. Primary outcomes were  safety and feasibility indicators, and distress was measured by the Paediatric  Symptom Checklist. RESULTS: In November 2018, 179 children were screened; 61  (33%) met criteria for distress (34.1%), two were excluded for suicidal risk, and  59 were randomized (EASE = 33, ETAU = 26).

A stratified 2-stage random sample was drawn from the 2007 population  census, with strata formed by crossing the 12 governorates with urban, rural and  refugee camp locations. Within strata, 208 survey clusters were sampled with  probability proportional to size. Within each cluster, 14 households with youth  of the appropriate age were sampled. RESULTS: Among youth aged 20-24 years, 22.4%  of males and 11.6% of females reported trying alcohol; 10.5% of males and 4.3% of  females reported trying drugs. Almost one quarter of unmarried youth aged 20-24  years reported any sexual experience. Tobacco use is high, even among younger  youth (45.4% of males and 21.2% of females aged 15-19 smoke). Risk behaviours are  higher among males, older youth and in urban areas and refugee camps. CONCLUSION:  While smoking is of particular concern, prevention outreach for all behaviours  should be directed at subgroups and areas identified as highest risk.",2018-05-03,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,,127-136,,2,24,,East Mediterr Health J,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © World Health Organization (WHO) 2018.

The effect  of mental health problems on cognitive development has been studied by  researchers for the last 2 decades. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we sought to use  machine learning techniques to predict the risk factors associated with  schoolchildren's depression and anxiety. METHODS: The study sample consisted of  3984 students in fifth to ninth grades, aged 10-15 years, studying at public and  refugee schools in the West Bank. The data were collected using the health  behaviors schoolchildren questionnaire in the 2013-2014 academic year and  analyzed using machine learning to predict the risk factors associated with  student mental health symptoms. We used 5 machine learning techniques (random  forest [RF], neural network, decision tree, support vector machine [SVM], and  naive Bayes) for prediction. RESULTS: The results indicated that the SVM and RF  models had the highest accuracy levels for depression (SVM: 92.5%; RF: 76.4%) and  anxiety (SVM: 92.4%; RF: 78.6%). Thus, the SVM and RF models had the best  performance in classifying and predicting the students' depression and anxiety.  The results showed that school violence and bullying, home violence, academic  performance, and family income were the most important factors affecting the  depression and anxiety scales. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, machine learning proved to  be an efficient tool for identifying and predicting the associated factors that  influence student depression and anxiety. The machine learning techniques seem to  be a good model for predicting abnormal depression and anxiety symptoms among  schoolchildren, so the deployment of machine learning within the school  information systems might facilitate the development of health prevention and  intervention programs that will enhance students' mental health and cognitive  development.",2022-08-31,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,e32736,,8,6,,JMIR Form Res,,,,,,,,eng,"©Radwan Qasrawi, Stephanny Paola Vicuna Polo, Diala Abu Al-Halawa, Sameh Hallaq, Ziad Abdeen.

What remains sparse is research spanning multiple risk and protective  factors and examining their unique, and relative implications to difficulties on  emotion dysregulation in refugee girls. This study investigated the mechanisms  through which emotion dysregulation in Syrian refugee girls is impacted by  exposure to war traumas, comorbidities, and other risk and protective factors  such as coping styles, family relationships, and school environment. The sample  consisted of 539 Syrian refugee girls who ranged in age from 7 to 18 years  attending public schools in various governorates in Lebanon and Jordan. Two  school counselors carried out the interviews with children at school. Results  indicated that war trauma and the combination of comorbidities associated with  negative coping styles could lead to an overall state of emotion dysregulation in  refugee girls. Enhanced understanding of the mechanistic role of risk and  protective factors in contributing to emotion dysregulation in refugee girls may  contribute to the development of effective interventions to target the  psychological effects of the refugee experience.

Public health,,2468-2667,10.1016/S2468-2667(18)30051-3,,"BACKGROUND: Children and adolescents, who account for most of the world's refugees, have an increased prevalence of psychological disorders. The mental  health of refugee children is often associated with the severity of  post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in their caregivers. Despite the potential  for refugee caregivers' PTSD to affect child mental health, little evidence  exists concerning the underlying mechanisms of this association. This study  tested the effect of refugee caregivers' previous trauma and levels of ongoing  stressors on current PTSD, and in turn how this influences parenting behaviour  and consequent child psychological health. METHODS: This cohort study recruited  participants from the Building a New Life in Australia study, a population-based  prospective cohort study of refugees admitted to 11 sites in Australia between  October, 2013, and February, 2014. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or  older and the principal or secondary applicant (ie, the refugee applicant within  a migrating family unit) for a humanitarian visa awarded between May, 2013, and  December, 2013. Primary caregiver PTSD and postmigration difficulties were  assessed at Wave 1 (in 2013), and caregiver PTSD was reassessed at Wave 2 (in  2014). At Wave 3, between October, 2015, and February, 2016, primary caregivers  repeated measures of trauma history, postmigration difficulties, probable PTSD,  and harsh and warm parenting style, and completed the Strengths and Difficulties  Questionnaire for their child. We used path analysis to investigate temporal  patterns in PTSD, trauma history, postmigration stressors, parenting style, and  children's psychological difficulties. FINDINGS: The current data comprised 411  primary caregivers who provided responses in relation to at least one child (660  children). 394 primary caregivers with 639 children had data on independent  variables and were included in the final model. Path analyses revealed that  caregivers' trauma history and postmigration difficulties were associated with  greater subsequent PTSD, which in turn was associated with greater harsh  parenting and in turn, higher levels of child conduct problems (β=0·049,  p=0·0214), hyperactivity (β=0·044, p=0·0241), emotional symptoms (β=0·041,  p=0·0218), and peer problems (β=0·007, p=0·047). There was also a direct path  from primary caregiver PTSD to children's emotional problems (β=0·144, p=0·0001).  INTERPRETATION: PTSD in refugees is associated with harsh parenting styles,  leading to adverse effects on their children's mental health. Programmes to  enhance refugee children's mental health should account for PTSD in parents and  caregivers, and the parenting behaviours that these children are exposed to.

One specific group of children staying in reception  facilities under governmental supervision comprises unaccompanied refugee  children who have fled to a host country without their parents. OBJECTIVE: This  qualitative study explores the experiences of unaccompanied children with regard  to violence in reception facilities in the Netherlands from the perspective of  the children. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: 183 unaccompanied children (N = 183)  sheltered in a variety of reception facilities in the Netherlands. METHOD:  Semi-structured interviews were conducted focusing on several topics related to  their perceived quality of life. The transcripts of the interviews were analyzed  for experiences with violence occurring inside the reception facilities.

RESULTS: A large share (66 %) of the unaccompanied children had  experienced violence in various reception facilities. Most of the experiences  reported had to do with either physical and emotional abuse and neglect or  institutional violence.

Yet, the body of research examining school environmental  factors that support the mental health and acculturation of refugee children is  methodologically heterogeneous, investigates numerous and disparate school  factors, and is often ""hidden"" in broader qualitative studies. This limits the  capacity to apply the findings in a practical manner. METHODS: Based on PRISMA  statement principles, we review the relevant literature to investigate the  relationship between school climate and the emotional wellbeing and resettlement  outcomes of refugee students. Six electronic databases will be systematically  searched: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, CINAL, Web of Science, and ERIC,  supplemented by a systematic review of the grey literature, relevant  international websites, and sequential, site-specific internet searches. Finally,  subject area experts will be consulted and backward and forward citation searches  of included articles will be completed. Two independent reviewers will screen  identified articles against eligibility criteria and extract data for included  studies. Quality of included studies will be assessed using the Mixed Methods  Appraisal Tool (MMAT) for mixed studies reviews. Data will be synthesised using a  convergent qualitative narrative approach. DISCUSSION: Given the centrality of  school in the daily lives of resettled refugee children, it is vital to assess  the impact of school climate on the psychosocial wellbeing and resettlement  trajectories of this population. This review will identify evidence-based school  factors which support good mental health and resettlement outcomes for refugee  students and make recommendations for translation of this knowledge into the  school environment.

Providing appropriate support services and educational  resources that address the unique concerns of families of refugee background will  allow for improved family cohesion and developmental outcomes for children.  Parenting programs have been shown to be successful in improving parental stress,  parental efficacy, and children's mental health and well-being. This study  gathers data about the experiences of caregivers of refugee background in order  to develop a novel, multi-dimensional parenting program model using  Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) principles. METHODOLOGY: This was a  qualitative, CBPR study using a formative research framework. In-depth interviews  (IDIs) were conducted with caregivers of refugee background and service providers  that work closely with this population. Data were recorded, transcribed, and  coded using deductive and inductive coding methods by two independent coders.  RESULTS: A total of 20 IDIs were conducted (7 caregivers and 13 service  providers). The main topics that were identified to be incorporated into the  program include: features of child development, how to address resettlement  issues, child advocacy, and parenting after resettlement. Participants felt that  tackling language barriers, addressing the overlapping responsibilities of  caregivers attending the sessions, providing incentives, increasing awareness of  the program, and using an anti-racist and anti-oppressive approach was key to the  program's success. Participants emphasized the need for trauma-informed mental  health supports within the program model.

This pilot study aimed to identify early  putative risk factors associated with psychological symptoms in newly resettled  refugee youth at potential risk of subsequently developing mental disorders.  METHODS: Newly resettled adolescent refugees were recruited through English  language schools in Melbourne, Australia. Participants were assessed with the  MINI-Kid, Achenbach Youth Self-Report and Reaction of Adolescents to Traumatic  Stress scale. Parents completed a mental health screening separately. Linear  regression models were used to identify predictive factors associated with  symptom ratings. RESULTS: Seventy-eight, ostensibly well, refugee adolescents  (mean age = 15.0 ± 1.6 years) resettled in Australia for 6.1 ± 4.2 months were  assessed. Levels of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress symptoms were  considerably lower than in mainstream population data. Prior displacement was a  key determinant of symptomatology. Transitory displacement, irrespective of  duration, was associated with elevated scores for depression (t (47) = -4.05,  p < 0.0001), avoidance/numbing (U = 466, p < .05) and total trauma (U = 506,  p < .05) symptoms. Older age was a unique predictor of depression (F  (1,74) = 8.98, p < .01), internalising (F(1,74) = 6.28, p < .05) and total  (F(1,74) = 4.10, p < .05) symptoms, whilst parental depression symptoms  (t = 2.01, p < 0.05), displacement (t = 3.35, p < 0.01) and, expectedly, trauma  exposure (t = 3.94, p < 0.001) were unique predictors of post-traumatic stress  symptoms.

Network analysis might help clinicians to both  understand which symptoms might trigger other symptoms, and to identify relevant  targets for treatment. However, to date only two studies have applied the network  analysis approach to an (adult) refugee population and only three studies  examined this approach in children and adolescents. Objective: The aim of this  study is to explore the network structure and centrality of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms  in a cross-sectional sample of severely traumatized refugee minors. Method: A  total of N = 419 (M (age) = 16.3; 90.7% male) unaccompanied (79.9%) and  accompanied (20.1%) refugee minors were recruited in five studies in southern  Germany. PTSD symptoms were assessed using the Child and Adolescent Trauma Screen  (CATS). The network was estimated using state-of-the-art regularized partial  correlation models using the R-package qgraph. Results: The most central symptoms  were nightmares, physiological and psychological reactivity, and concentration  problems. The strongest connections between symptoms were established for  psychological and physiological reactivity, irritability/anger and  self-destructive/reckless behaviour, intrusions and nightmares, nightmares and  sleep disturbance, and between concentrations problems and sleep disturbance.  Conclusion: This study furnishes information relevant to research and the  clinical management of PTSD in refugee minors, and also in terms of comparisons  with trauma-exposed children and adolescents without a migration background.  Re-experiencing symptoms seem to be central in the refugee minor PTSD profile and  thus merit special consideration in the diagnostic and treatment evaluation  process. Investigating the PTSD network longitudinally and complementing  between-subject analyses with within-subject ones might provide further insight  into the symptomatology of refugee minors and how to treat them successfully.",2019,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1675990,,1,10,,Eur J Psychotraumatol,,,,,,,,eng,"© 2019 The Author(s).

Although they are a population with an elevated risk of  health problems due to adverse pre-migratory and post-migratory experiences, few  studies have explored their health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This is  considered a fundamental construct in public health and might provide  complementary descriptions of their health and well-being after resettling in a  new country. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 160 Syrian youth aged  13-24 years. Using KIDSCREEN-27, the results for five dimensions of HRQoL was  compared to population norm data. Demographic factors and war-related adverse  events were used to predict HRQoL in hierarchical regression. Results: For most  participants, the overall HRQoL was good, but it was lower in the dimensions for  friends, physical well-being and psychological well-being compared to population  norms. Scores in the dimensions for autonomy/parental relation and the school  environment were high and were the main contributors to a positive HRQoL. Age and  number of reported stressful events (SE) had the greatest impact on HRQoL, but  the final regression model only accounted for 21% of the total variance.  Conclusions: HRQoL is a relevant and non-invasive measure for refugee youth.  Contributors to lower scores in physical and psychological well-being should be  explored further and indicate the potential for future interventions focussing on  general psychological well-being and networks, regardless of the SE that have  been experienced.

We sought to examine whether the association of multimorbidity patterns  and LMM differs in refugee youth compared to Swedish-born youth and identify the  diagnostic groups driving this association. METHODOLOGY: We analyzed 249,245  individuals between 20-25 years, on 31 December 2011, from a combined Swedish  registry. Refugees were matched 1:5 to Swedish-born youth. A multimorbidity score  was computed from a network of disease co-occurrences in 2009-2011. LMM was  defined as disability pension (DP) or >180 days of unemployment during 2012-2016.  Relative risks (RR) of LMM were calculated for 114 diagnostic groups (2009-2011).  The odds of LMM as a function of multimorbidity score were estimated using  logistic regression. RESULTS: 2841 (1.1%) individuals received DP and 16,323  (6.5%) experienced >180 annual days of unemployment during follow-up. Refugee  youth had a marginally higher risk of DP (OR (95% CI): 1.59 (1.52, 1.67))  depending on their multimorbidity score compared to Swedish-born youth (OR (95%  CI): 1.51 (1.48, 1.54)); no differences were found for unemployment (OR (95% CI):  1.15 (1.12, 1.17), 1.12 (1.10, 1.14), respectively).

Teaching Recovery Techniques (TRT) was introduced as a community-based  intervention utilising trained lay counsellors in a stepped model of care for  refugee youth experiencing trauma symptoms. Professionals (e.g., teachers, social  workers) can deliver the Cognitive Behavioural Therapy-based intervention after a  brief training. A point of debate in this workforce solution is the readiness of  trained lay counsellors to deal with potentially demanding situations like  disclosure of suicidal ideation. This study aimed to explore the TRT trained lay  counsellors' experiences of procedures upon URM's disclosure of suicidal  ideation. Individual semi-structured interviews with TRT trained lay counsellors  were conducted, then analysed using systemic text condensation. The analysis  revealed four themes: ""Importance of safety structures"", ""Collaboration is key"",  ""Let sleeping dogs lie"" and ""Going the extra mile"". Dealing with suicidal  ideation is challenging and feelings of helplessness occur. Adding adequate  supervision and specific training on suicidal ideation using role play is  recommended. Collaboration between agencies and key stakeholders is essential  when targeting refugee mental health in a stepped care model.",2021-02-04,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,4,18,,Int J Environ Res Public Health,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: Switzerland PMID: 33557361  PMCID: PMC7914504,,,,Humans; Adolescent; Suicidal Ideation; *Refugees; Sweden; unaccompanied refugee minors; *Counselors; cognitive behaviour therapy; group intervention; Health Workforce; mental health workforce; stepped care model; teaching recovery techniques; trained lay counsellors; workforce solution,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This service has increased the need for timely and accurate information to  facilitate planning, resource allocation and decision-making. Complexity in  providing effective public health interventions in refugee settings coupled with  increased funding requirements has created demands for better data and improved  accountability. Health data management in refugee settings is faced with several  information gaps that require harmonisation of the Ugandan National Health  Management Information System (UHMIS) and United Nations High Commission for  Refugees (UNHCR) Refugee Health Information System (RHIS). This article discusses  the rationale for harmonisation of the UNHCR RHIS, which currently captures  refugee data, with the UHMIS. It also provides insights into how refugee health  data management can be harmonised within a country's national health management  information system. METHOD: A consultative meeting with various stakeholders,  including the Ugandan Ministry of Health, district health teams, representatives  from UNHCR, the United Nations Children Education Fund (UNICEF), United States  Government and civil society organisations, was held with an aim to review the  UHMIS and UNHCR RHIS health data management systems and identify ways to  harmonise the two to achieve an integrated system for monitoring health service  delivery in Uganda. RESULTS: Several challenges facing refugee-hosting district  health teams with regard to health data management were identified, including  data collection, analysis and reporting. There was unanimous agreement to  prioritise an integrated data management system and harmonisation of national  refugee stakeholder data requirements, guided by key recommendations developed at  the meeting. CONCLUSION: This article outlines a proposed model that can be used  to harmonise the UNHCR RHIS with the UHMIS. The national refugee stakeholder data  requirements have been harmonised, and Uganda looks forward to achieving better  health data quality through a more comprehensive national UHMIS to inform policy  planning and evidence-based decision-making.",Sep-21,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,149-156,,3,50,,Health Inf Manag,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: Australia PMID: 31805785,,,,Humans; United States; Child; public health; *Refugees; refugees; Uganda; United Nations; *Health Information Management; *Health Information Systems; decision-making; delivery of healthcare; health information systems; management information systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Public health,,2468-2667,10.1016/S2468-2667(22)00194-3,,"BACKGROUND: Children in families who are refugees might experience more adversities than their peers. Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are well known  risk factors for poorer adulthood health and adjustment. The risk of ACEs for  children with a parent who is a refugee affected by trauma is unknown. We aimed  to estimate the hazard of individual and cumulative ACEs using a unique sample of  children with parents who are refugees affected by and seeking treatment for  trauma and population level data. METHODS: This was a register-based cohort study  carried out in Denmark. All children aged 0-15 years, residing in Denmark between  Jan 1, 1990, and Dec 31, 2016, were followed up from birth or migration into the  country to their 15th birthday. We linked data from the Danish Civil Registration  System, the Danish National Patient Register, the Danish Psychiatric Central  Research Register, the Employment Classification Module, the Register of Causes  of Death, and the Income Statistics Register to investigate ten ACE categories  (parental: natural and unnatural death, serious mental illness, substance use  disorder, somatic illness, and disability; child: residential instability, family  disruption, poverty, and stressors) and the cumulative number of ACE categories  for children with a parent from a refugee-sending country and children with a  parent who is a refugee in treatment for trauma. The main outcome was the hazard  ratio (HR) of the individual and cumulative ACEs among children with a parent  from a refugee-sending country and children with a parent who is a refugee  affected by trauma, compared with the general population of children in Denmark,  both adjusted and unadjusted for parental country of origin. FINDINGS: 2 688 794  children were included in the study, 252 310 of whom had parents from  refugee-sending countries. 11 603 children had parents affected by trauma and  seeking treatment, of whom 1163 (10%) migrated to Denmark before their second  birthday and 10 440 (90%) were born in Denmark. Compared with the general  population of children in Denmark, the hazard for most ACEs was significantly  higher for both children with parents from a refugee-sending country and children  with parents who are refugees affected by trauma. For children with a parent from  a refugee-sending country, the highest HR was related to the child living in  relative poverty for 3 years (3·62 [95% CI 3·52-3·73]). After adjusting for  parental country of origin, the hazards for five ACEs were significantly greater  for children of parents who are refugees affected by trauma compared with the  remaining children of parents from the same countries. The highest HR for this  child group was for parental serious mental illness (1·98 [1·85-2·12]). The  hazard for experiencing multiple ACEs was significantly higher for both child  groups compared with the general population. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest  that children with parents from refugee-sending countries have a higher rate of  several ACEs compared with the general population. Furthermore, having a parent  who is a refugee affected by trauma and seeking treatment seems to be an  independent risk factor for poorer health and adjustment in adulthood. This study  informs decision makers and caregivers that there might be much added value in  addressing needs within the whole family, as opposed to only attending to the  parent who is seeking treatment.

HRQoL is enormously affected by  the satisfaction of this vulnerable group with the physical, psychological,  emotional and social care services provided in this critical time. Therefore,  this study aimed toassess the HRQoL among Syrian refugee women of reproductive  age living outside camps in Jordan. METHODS: A cross-sectional correlational  study was conducted with a convenience sample of 523 Syrian refugee women in the  host communities in Jordan.Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was measured  using the short-form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire. RESULTS: Significant negative  correlations were found between SF-36 individual subscales score and the length  of marriage, the number of children, parity and family income. The strongest  correlations were between pain scale and length of marriage (r =  - .21), and  between Energy/Fatigue and 'number of children' (r =  - .21). Conversely,  antenatal care was positively correlated with physical, role emotional, pain, and  general health. Physical functioning and general health were predicted  significantly with less years of marriage, younger age at marriage, less violence  and by higher family income. CONCLUSION: This study suggests low HRQoL scores for  women of reproductive age across all domains. Several factors such as years of  marriage, age at marriage, the number of children, violence, antenatal care and  family income affected the women's general health. The provision of appropriate  and accessible reproductive and maternal healthcare services in antenatal visits  is critical for ensuring the immediate and long-term health and wellbeing of  refugee women and their families.",2020,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,e9990,,,8,,PeerJ,,,,,,,,eng,©2020 Nabolsi et al.,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 33024636  PMCID: PMC7519719,,,,Women; Refugee; Jordan; Reproductive health; Syrian; HRQoL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Using a  large longitudinal database of linked national registers, we established a  retrospective cohort of 1,328,397 people born 1984-1988 comparing minors born in  Sweden to 2 Swedish-born parents (95.4%) to minors who had been arriving in  Sweden between 2002 and 2011 with a permanent resident permit and were either  unaccompanied refugee minors (0.4%), or accompanied migrant minors (4.0%). The  outcome measures were different measures of psychiatric care including in- and  outpatient care, and prescribed psychotropic medication. RESULT: Compared with  the Swedish-born minors the unaccompanied refugee minors had a higher likelihood  of utilisation of all psychiatric care except ADHD medication.

METHODS: The study population  included refugees born between 1972 and 1997 who immigrated before the age of 18  and settled in the three Nordic countries during 1986-2005. This population was  followed up in national registers during 2006-2015 at ages 18-43 years and was  compared with native-born majority populations in the same birth cohorts using  sex-stratified and age-adjusted regression analyses. RESULTS: Refugee men in  Denmark stood out with a consistent pattern of higher risks for mortality,  disability/illness pension, psychiatric care and substance misuse relative to  native-born majority Danish men, with risk estimates being higher than comparable  estimates observed among refugee men in Norway and Sweden. Refugee men in Sweden  and Norway also demonstrated increased risks relative to native-born majority  population men for inpatient psychiatric care, and in Sweden also for  disability/illness pension. With the exception of increased risk for psychotic  disorders, outcomes among refugee women were largely similar to or better than  those of native-born majority women in all countries. CONCLUSIONS: The observed  cross-country differences in health indicators among refugees, and the poorer  health outcomes of refugee men in Denmark in particular, may be understood in  terms of marked differences in Nordic integration policies.

The FSI-R aims to  promote youth mental health and family relationships. We hypothesized that FSI-R  families would have better psychosocial outcomes and family functioning  postintervention compared with care-as-usual (CAU) families. We hypothesized that  FSI-R would be feasible to implement and accepted by communities. METHODS: A  total of 40 Somali Bantu (n = 103 children, 58.40% female; n = 43 caregivers,  79.00% female) and 40 Bhutanese (n = 49 children, 55.30% female; n = 62  caregivers, 54.00% female) families were randomized to receive FSI-R or CAU.  Refugee research assistants conducted psychosocial assessments pre- and  post-intervention, and home visitors delivered the preventive intervention.  Multilevel modeling assessed the effects of FSI-R. Feasibility was measured from  retention, and acceptability was measured from satisfaction surveys. RESULTS: The  retention rate of 82.50% indicates high feasibility, and high reports of  satisfaction (81.50%) indicate community acceptance. Across communities, FSI-R  children reported reduced traumatic stress reactions, and caregivers reported  fewer child depression symptoms compared with CAU families (β = -.42; p = .03;  β = -.34; p = .001). Bhutanese FSI-R children reported reduced family arguing  (β = -1.32; p = .04) and showed fewer depression symptoms and conduct problems by  parent report (β = -9.20; p = .04; β = -.92; p = .01) compared with CAU.

This article aims to  provide an overview of how the current sociopolitical context threatens the  public health of refugee and immigrant communities and to describe the role of  psychologists in advocating for social justice and responding to this urgent  public health need through interprofessional collaboration and translation of  scientific knowledge into multilevel intervention development. The case study of  the You're Not Alone (YNA) initiative describes swiftly mobilized advocacy  efforts (e.g., press conference, webinars, resources development and  dissemination) and participatory development and roll-out of community  capacity-building trainings to address the needs of refugee/immigrant children  and families. Trainings aimed to raise awareness of the refugee/immigrant  experience and to equip refugee/immigrant community members and providers across  a variety of public sectors to implement culturally responsive and  trauma-informed strategies to promote resilience, respond to distress, and  prevent mental health crises. Between March 2017 and June 2018, a total of 1,642  individuals attended 48 training events. The role of psychologists in future  policy and advocacy efforts to promote mental health among refugee/immigrant  families is discussed as well as implications for how other marginalized  communities affected by the current sociopolitical climate might benefit from  broadening the scope of this public health response.

Initial data suggest  that a gap of vaccination among (school) children of refugee families might have  emerged in the period between the first general inspection on arrival (the first  central health measure) and the transition to the local health care system.  OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to obtain the opinion of practicing  paediatricians regarding the vaccination status of refugee children to examine  whether a variance in the measles, mumps, rubella (varicella) vaccination  schedule might have emerged between the periods of initial admission and school  enrolment examination. Evaluations of both inhibiting and promoting conditions  should generate fields of action regarding the systematic integration into the  regular health care system. METHOD: Qualitative interviews with experts as well  as a quantitative questionnaire survey to measure the opinion of registered  paediatricians in Münster were analyzed. RESULTS: The assessments showed that  there was no clear vaccination gap among (school) children of refugee families.  One challenge was the systematic integration into the local outpatient care  system. Critical issues were inadequate vaccination education, language barriers,  and frequent changes in location. The vaccination engagement and vaccination  behaviour of refugees were assessed as most positive. International standards, in  particular the sphere standards, attracted insufficient attention in practical  implementation within the refugee relief programs.

Yet, little is known about their own perspectives on what can  relieve their mental health problems. The aim was to explore unaccompanied  refugee adolescents' perspectives on healing and the mental healthcare offered to  them when resettled. The study was based on methodical triangulation of  participant observation in a Danish municipal institution for unaccompanied  refugee minors, semi-structured individual interviews with experts, social  workers and male refugee minors and a focus group interview with refugee minors.  Results show that the refugee adolescents associated traditional conversational  therapy with discussing negative and stigmatising aspects of their past and  carrying risks of re-traumatisation. Instead, alternative activities were  proposed, through which resources could be accumulated and they could be met  without stereotype.Conclusion: To enhance the complex mental health needs of  unaccompanied minors' mental healthcare, the perspective of the refugee  adolescents should be taken into account. This calls for a holistic approach to  mental healthcare in their daily lives, where they are met in a non-stigmatising  manner in which their unique capabilities are the main focus.

It explores innovative solutions to the  issues facing refugees looking for professional health training, namely the  health workforce shortage and lack of training opportunities. It outlines social  and political factors that impact professional health education for refugee  youth. It outlines barriers and facilitators on the implementation of 'Distance  Basic Training of Healthcare Professionals', a blended training course provided  by the University of Geneva to junior health care personnel in Dadaab Refugee  camp. METHODS: This case uses mixed methods. Descriptive statistics drawn from  online surveys, learning analytics data, and exchanges on online forums and  student chat groups are all used. Qualitative methods consist of two focus  groups, comprising of all students (n = 27) were convened, as well as, individual  semi-structured interviews with 14 of the 27 students; three with managers from  the health service who supervised enrolled students; and two with senior managers  who were responsible for staff and training decision-making. Qualitative data was  transcribed, and thematic analyses were applied. RESULTS: The results demonstrate  that barriers for the implementation of professional education in a refugee camp  emerged not only from the constraints on the environment, but also from barriers  stemming from legislation and administrative procedures. Data suggested  weaknesses on the education system could be addressed by providing students with  extra-curricular support, information and communications technology (ICT)  literacy, and promoting mechanisms for peer support while broadening entry  requirements to increase the enrolment of female students.

Recent data on the rate of airway infections and factors influencing their spread in refugee  reception centers is scarce. Methods: A retrospective, cross-sectional study of  de-identified medical records with a focus on respiratory infections in underage  refugees was conducted at two large German refugee reception centers. Results: In  total, medical data from n = 10,431 refugees over an observational period of n =  819 days was analyzed. Among pediatric patients (n = 4289), 55.3% presented at  least once to the on-site medical ward with an acute respiratory infection or  signs thereof.

With its diverse population, the city is a  space in which both racialization of blackness occurs and ""multicultural""  ethno-racial diversity is imagined. In this spatiality of youths' everyday lives,  interracial sexuality emerges as transgression. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork  with heterosexual male youth from sixteen to twenty-five years of age who have  recently emigrated from various African countries, we examine how interracial  sexuality was constituted through what our interlocutors said and did. We trace  and analyze how sexual transgression associated with the desirability and taboo  of white femininity was played out through social-spatial networks and practices  within the changing urban landscape. The formation of sexuality within global,  transnational, and urban contexts of settlement is not simply a matter of global  forces affecting the local or local affecting the global. By ethnographically  situating interracial sexuality in a diverse urban locale where migrant youth are  navigating multiple boundaries of race, nation, and sexuality in the  transformation of their identities and subjectivities, we offer one story of how  interracial sexualities are constituted in a specific time and place. Within  Canada, newly arrived immigrant and refugee African young men are mired in the  histories of taboo over sexual relations with white women while being key actors  in transformations of heterosexuality, masculinity, blackness, and whiteness  occurring through immigration and settlement processes.

The objectives of this study were 1) to quantify the prevalence of  anemia among African African asylum seeking children treated in the Terem Clinic  for refugees in Tel Aviv; 2) to compare it to the rates among Jewish Israeli  children; 3) and to correlate it with their nutritional iron intake. Overall,  this effort aims at informing changes in policies and practices that will ensure  healthy development of African asylum seeking children in Israel. METHODS: The  prevalence of anemia was calculated for all toddlers and children under the age  of twelve years visiting the refugee clinic and compared to the recently reported  rates of anemia among urban Jewish Israeli children of similar ages; Nutritional  iron intake was calculated in a subgroup by a food frequency questionnaire  translated to Amharic and Tigrinya. RESULTS: Mean age of the children (SD) was  2.96 yr. (SD 2.77) and mean hemoglobin 10.88 g/dl (1.47). Out of 386 eligible  children, 131(34%) were anemic, fourfold more prevalent than reported among 263  Jewish toddlers and young children of the same age group [(11%), OR 4.15(95% ci  2.67-6.43)]. In a subgroup (n = 26) investigated for amount of daily iron intake,  46.2% did not receive the recommended daily allowance for their age. Nine of them  had received iron supplements. CONCLUSIONS: Low hemoglobin levels are four-fold  more prevalent among the African asylum seeking children. The dietary data  suggest iron deficiency as a major cause, although other etiologies need to be  ruled out. Because of the adverse long term impact of early anemia on child  development, new policies need to be developed to ensure that refugee children  develop in a healthy manner. These should include routine mandatory supplements  of iron for all refugee children, in parallel to developing an educational  program for parents how to achieve iron-sufficient diets for their children.

Drawing on data  from 635 young refugees aged between 15 and 26 in South Australia, 116 refugees  with paid work were compared with 519 refugee students without work, and a sample  of young workers from Australian Workplace Barometer (AWB) data (n = 290). The  results indicated that refugees with paid work had significantly lower  psychological distress compared with refugees with no paid work, but more  distress than other young Australian workers. With respect to workplace  harassment and abuse, young refugee workers reported significantly more  harassment due to their ongoing interaction and engagement with mainstream  Australian workers compared with unemployed refugees. Harassment played a vital  role in affecting psychological health in refugees (particularly) and other young  workers. While refugee youth experienced harassment at work, overall, their  experiences suggest that their younger age upon arrival enabled them to seek and  find positive employment outcomes. Although PSC did not differ significantly  between the employed groups, we found that it likely negatively influenced  psychological distress through the mediating effects of harassment and abuse.  Hence, fostering pathways to successful employment and creating safe work based  on high PSC and less harassment are strongly recommended to improve refugees'  mental health and adaptation.",2021-10-12,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,20,18,,Int J Environ Res Public Health,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: Switzerland PMID: 34682442  PMCID: PMC8535317,,,,"Humans; Adult; Adolescent; Young Adult; Workplace; Australia; *Refugees; Stress, Psychological; *Psychological Distress; psychological distress; harassment; Organizational Culture; psychological demands; psychosocial safety climate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To explore this, we analyzed the factors associated with  motherhood among refugee AGYW in Kampala, Uganda. Between January and March 2018,  peer researchers recruited refugee youth aged 15-24 and living in five informal  settlements in Kampala to participate in this study. We used a backwards  generalized linear model with a log binomial regression to determine if mental  health, resource insecurity and sexual and reproductive health variables were  associated with motherhood among study participants.

METHOD: Written answers on five questions  given by N = 9 therapists on N = 16 TF-CBT cases were analysed qualitatively  using Mayring's content analysis. The questions were on (1) additional techniques  used in the sessions, (2) obstacles to TF-CBT treatment, (3) cultural factors  considered and most helpful components for (4) patient and (5) therapist. The  categories were built inductively and analysed descriptively. RESULTS: In  addition to the regular TF-CBT components, added content mostly concerned the  so-called ""crisis of the week"", meaning a more lengthy discussion of struggles  and concerns in their daily lives.

Vaccination costs were  estimated from the U.S. Vaccines for Children Program and Medicaid reimbursement  rates during fiscal year 2015. RESULTS: All clinics reviewed overseas vaccination  records before vaccinating, but all records were not transferred into state  immunization systems. Average vaccination costs per refugee varied from $120 to  $211 by site. The total average cost of domestic vaccination was 15% less among  refugees arriving from VPR- vs. nonVPR-participating countries during a single  domestic visit. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that immunization practices and  costs vary between clinics, and that clinics adapted their vaccination practices  to accommodate VPR doses, yielding potential cost savings.",2018-05-11,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,2902-2909,,20,36,,Vaccine,,,,,,,,eng,Published by Elsevier Ltd.,,,,,,Place: Netherlands PMID: 29395535  PMCID: PMC6961801,,,,Humans; United States; *Refugees; Refugee health; *Health Care Costs; Cost-benefit; Refugee immunizations; Vaccination/*economics; Vaccine costs; Vaccine preventable diseases; Vaccines/*administration & dosage/*economics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current study examined health care use due to CMDs  in unaccompanied and accompanied refugee youth and Swedish-born, and the role of  education and residency duration. METHODS: This longitudinal cohort study  included 746,517 individuals (whereof 36,347 refugees) between 19 and 25 years,  residing in Sweden in 2009. Refugees were classified as  unaccompanied/accompanied. Risk estimates of CMDs, measured as health care use  and antidepressant treatment, between 2010-2016 were calculated as adjusted  hazard ratios (aHR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Highest attained  education in 2009, and residency duration were examined as potential modifiers.  RESULTS: Compared to Swedish-born youth, refugees had a lower risk of treated  major depressive and anxiety disorders (aHR): 0.67 (95% CI 0.63-0.72) and 0.67  (95% CI 0.63-0.71) respectively), but a higher risk for posttraumatic stress  disorders (PTSD). Compared to Swedish-born, unaccompanied had a nearly 6-fold  elevated risk for PTSD (aHR: 5.82, 95% CI 4.60-7.34) and accompanied refugees had  a 3-fold risk of PTSD (aHR: 3.08, 95% CI 2.54-3.74). Rates of PTSD decreased with  years spent in Sweden. The risk of CMDs decreased with increasing education.  LIMITATIONS: The study lacked information on pre-migration factors. There may  further be a potential misclassification of untreated CMDs. CONCLUSION: Refugees  had a lower risk of treated depressive and anxiety disorders but a higher risk  for PTSD. In refugees, the rates of anxiety disorders increased slightly over  time whereas the rates of PTSD decreased.

However, little research has been done on  adolescent Syrian refugees. This study aimed to fill that gap in the research  literature by examining how adolescent Syrian refugees cope with the harsh  situation of having fled from their homes. We explored how personal capital  factors, sense of coherence (SOC), wishes, and expectations, as well as  socio-demographic and situational factors, contribute to a variety of mental  health and psychological problems, namely, internalizing and externalizing  problems and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Data were gathered from 110  adolescents aged 13-18 of whom 50.9% were boys. Participants filled out  self-report questionnaires that asked about demographics, exposure to war,  appraisal of danger, receiving aid, SOC, wishes, and expectations. They also  completed the Achenbach Youth Form. The results show that girls appraised their  situation as more dangerous and reported more internalizing, externalizing, and  post-traumatic stress symptoms. By contrast, boys reported more exposure to war  experiences and stronger SOC. Younger adolescents reported stronger SOC, while  older adolescents reported more psychological problems. The adolescents who had  more recently arrived in the refugee camp were in better condition, thereby  reporting stronger SOC, higher expectations, and fewer psychological problems.  The amount of time spent in the refugee camp, gender, exposure to war situations,  and appraisal of danger all contributed to the explained variance in the  different psychological problems. However, once the personal resource SOC was  entered into the model, it mediated the relationships between all of the  socio-demographic and situational variables, on the one hand, and the examined  psychological problems, on the other.

However, uptake of treatment referrals in primary care is low  among Somalis compared to other refugee groups. The objective of this analysis  was to understand specific resistances to US mental health care contributing to  this gap in coverage. One hundred and sixty-eight Somali men and women over the  age of 14, participated in 28 focus group from October 2017 to November 2018  discussing wellbeing and healthcare in the US. Transcripts were analyzed based on  critical discourse theory, informed by the theoretical work of Michel Foucault.  This study identified two primary discourses, one biomedical and the other driven  by Somali community mental health knowledge and social practice. Mental health as  an object of Muslim faith, nosological fusion of psychiatric illness terms, and  stigmatization and internal social control to limit disclosure were discussed. US  mental health services were described as giving off a bad vibe, and represented  external institutions of power, exacerbated by perceived discrimination. Somali  youth occupied social bridging positions between cultural vs. US knowledge and  practice. Three negotiating discourses emerged wherein participants created  discursive solutions to these sites of resistance, including 1) how the social  acceptability of seeking psychological care might be increased while maintaining  Somali emotional resilience, 2) stressing the need to seek medical care as a  practical supplement to spiritual care, and 3) highlighting the need for Somali  youth to enter health fields. Findings suggest that intervention strategies not  only ensure that services are culturally appropriate and sensitive to religion,  but also consider that services are potentially seen as both an extension of US  institutional power and an affront to Somali identity making.

We sought to determine the extent to which immigrants use the emergency  department as an entryway into mental health services. METHODS: We used linked  health and demographic administrative data sets to design a population-based  cohort study. We included youth (aged 10-24 yr) with an incident mental health  emergency department visit from 2010 to 2014 in Ontario, Canada (n = 118 851).  The main outcome measure was an emergency department visit for mental health  reasons without prior mental health care from a physician on an outpatient basis.  The main predictor of interest was immigrant status (refugee, non-refugee  immigrant and non-immigrant). Immigrant-specific predictors included time since  migration, and region and country of origin. We used Poisson models to estimate  adjusted rate ratios (aRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: The  cohort included 2194 (1.8%) refugee, 6680 (5.6%) non-refugee immigrant and 109  977 (92.5%) nonimmigrant youth. Rates of first mental health contact in the  emergency department were higher among refugee (61.3%) and non-refugee immigrant  youth (57.6%) than non-immigrant youth (51.3%) (refugee aRR 1.17, 95% CI  1.13-1.21; non-refugee immigrant aRR 1.10, 95% CI 1.08-1.13). Compared with  non-refugee immigrants, refugees had a higher rate of first mental health contact  in the emergency department (aRR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02-1.11). We also observed higher  rates among recent versus longer-term immigrants (aRR 1.10, 95% CI 1.05-1.16) and  immigrants from Central America (aRR 1.17, 95% CI 1.08-1.26) and Africa (aRR  1.15, 95% CI 1.06-1.24) versus from North America and Western Europe.  INTERPRETATION: Immigrant youth are more likely to present with a first mental  health crisis to the emergency department than non-immigrants, with variability  by region of origin and time since migration. Immigrants may face barriers to  access and use of outpatient mental health services from a physician. Efforts are  needed to reduce stigma and identify mental health problems early, before crisis,  among immigrant populations.",2018-10-09,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,E1183-E1191,,40,190,,CMAJ,,,,,,,,eng,© 2018 Joule Inc. or its licensors.,,,,,,Place: Canada PMID: 30301742  PMCID: PMC6175628,,,,"Humans; Female; Cross-Sectional Studies; Male; Child; Adolescent; Young Adult; Emigrants and Immigrants/*statistics & numerical data; Ontario; Patient Acceptance of Health Care/ethnology/*statistics & numerical data; Emergency Service, Hospital/*statistics & numerical data; Facilities and Services Utilization; Mental Disorders/ethnology/therapy; Mental Health Services/*statistics & numerical data; Refugees/statistics & numerical data",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: We retrospectively analyzed all QFTs (n = 6685) performed on  children aged 2-18 years between January 5, 2011, and August 18, 2014. Risk  factors for positive testing in the CHS population were identified by logistic  regression, and further assessed using a case-control comparison. Results from  CHS were compared with higher-TB-risk populations (refugee and TB clinics) in our  health system. RESULTS: Positive QFT occurred in 79 of 3745 (2.1%) CHS patients.  Positive rates increased with age (0.3% in age 2-5 years to 4.9% in age 13-18  years). Indeterminate results were uncommon (0.8%) including in children <5  (1.3%). Risk factors for positive tests in the CHS population included  non-Medicaid insured/uninsured and non-English/Spanish preferred language. In the  case-control analysis, birth/travel to/residence in a TB-endemic country was the  only identified risk factor for positive testing (OR 5.2 [95% CI 1.04-25.5]).  Rates of positive testing were lower in the CHS population than the refugee/TB  clinic populations, including among children age 2-5. DISCUSSION: QFT-based LTBI  screening was successfully introduced in our pediatric primary-care health  system, and supported our programmatic goals of identifying LTBI cases while  limiting unnecessary LTBI treatment courses. Increasing positive rates with age,  and higher rates in the refugee/TB populations compared with CHS, add indirect  evidence of adequate test sensitivity, even among young children, for whom data  on interferon-gamma release assay performance are limited.",Sep-18,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,202-209,,,200,,J Pediatr,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The Bridging  the Gap partnership programme in Victoria, Australia, was designed to find new  ways to improve the responsiveness of universal maternity and early child health  services for women and families of refugee background with the codesign and  implementation of iterative quality improvement and demonstration initiatives.  One goal of this 'whole-of-system' approach was to improve access to antenatal  care. The objective of this paper is to report refugee women's access to  hospital-based antenatal care over the period of health system reforms. METHODS  AND FINDINGS: The study was designed using an interrupted time series analysis  using routinely collected data from two hospital networks (four maternity  hospitals) at 6-month intervals during reform activity (January 2014 to December  2016). The sample included women of refugee background and a comparison group of  Australian-born women giving birth over the 3 years. We describe the proportions  of women of refugee background (1) attending seven or more antenatal visits and  (2) attending their first hospital visit at less than 16 weeks' gestation  compared over time and to Australian-born women using logistic regression  analyses. In total, 10% of births at participating hospitals were to women of  refugee background. Refugee women were born in over 35 countries, and at one  participating hospital, 40% required an interpreter. Compared with  Australian-born women, women of refugee background were of similar age at the  time of birth and were more likely to be having their second or subsequent baby  and have four or more children. At baseline, 60% of refugee-background women and  Australian-born women attended seven or more antenatal visits. Similar trends of  improvement over the 6-month time intervals were observed for both populations,  increasing to 80% of women at one hospital network having seven or more visits at  the final data collection period and 73% at the other network. In contrast, there  was a steady decrease in the proportion of women having their first hospital  visit at less than 16 weeks' gestation, which was most marked for women of  refugee background. Using an interrupted time series of observational data over  the period of improvement is limited compared with using a randomisation design,  which was not feasible in this setting.

The Healthy  Kitchens, Healthy Children programme implemented and examined the impact of a  two-pronged intervention that employed women through community kitchens to  deliver a subsidized healthy daily school snack to elementary-school children in  Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon. We describe the rationale, study design,  theorized impact pathways, and discuss lessons learned. DESIGN: The programme was  quasi-experimental. We conducted formative and process evaluation of both  components of the intervention to elucidate the pathways to programme impact.  SETTING: Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-three women  participated in the kitchens and provided subsidized snacks to 714 children.  RESULTS: Snacks were healthy, traditional Palestinian recipes designed by women  and a nutritionist. Participation fluctuated but eventually increased after  modifying the meals to ensure acceptability by children. The main challenges to  sustainability related to the need for subsidization of the meals and the lack of  school policies around the regulation of sales of school food, which together led  to fluctuations in programme participation. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides  lessons learned on the potential of this model to improve the human capital of  two generations of protracted refugees. The availability of schools as a constant  market for these social enterprises offers an opportunity for sustainable  livelihood generation and food security gains. Challenges to sustainability  remain and could be addressed through social (subsidies to support the programme)  and structural (policies to restrict unhealthy food sales) measures.",Apr-20,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,914-923,,5,23,,Public Health Nutr,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 31753059,,,,"Humans; Adult; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Child; Adolescent; Young Adult; Child, Preschool; Poverty; *Schools; *Refugees; Arabs; Lebanon; *Community Participation; *Food Assistance; *Food Supply; Community kitchens; Food Insecurity; Food security; Meals; Nutritive Value; Protracted refugee population; School nutrition programme; Snacks; Women’s empowerment",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The insecure visa  sample comprised children from Tamil asylum-seeking families, while the secure  visa sample was drawn from refugee families participating in the multi-ethnic  'Building a New Life in Australia' cohort study. Children in each sample were  assessed for current mental health problems and trauma exposure. Mothers were  assessed for trauma exposure, post-migration family stressors and post-traumatic  stress disorder (PTSD).

RESULTS: Data comprised 361 children, aged 10-18, and 242 mothers  across three levels of visa insecurity: permanent protection (n = 293), temporary  protection (n = 40) and bridging visa (n = 28). Modelling showed that (1) visa  insecurity was associated with poorer child mental health, (2) the association  was mediated sequentially by post-migration family stressors and maternal PTSD  and (3) the association was moderated by maternal PTSD.

In this contribution, we specify some  of these challenges and argue that, due to the deep intertwinement of different  aspects of these patients' condition, a 'situated approach' is required when  treating this population.When planning therapeutic interventions for preschoolers  with refugee background, their families should be conceived as unified systems  which in their social and transcultural embeddedness exhibit trans-individual  vulnerabilities and resources.

This study examined depression, loneliness and factors influencing refugee  children who live outside the camps and attend school in Turkey. METHODS: This  was a descriptive study in Sanliurfa, which has the second highest refugee  population in Turkey. The sample consisted of 535 students attending 6-8 grades  in five schools randomly selected of 18 schools located in the city centre where  the Syrian children received their education. Data were collected using the  Sociodemographic Characteristics Question Form, the Depression Scale for Children  and the UCLA Loneliness Scale. Data were analysed by IBM spss v23. The  percentage, average and standard deviation were determined. A linear regression  analysis was used to examine the independent variables affecting loneliness and  depression scores, and the Backward method was used to include independent  variables in the model. Significance level was considered as P < .05. RESULTS:  The average age of the children was 13.22 ± 1.33 years and 57.9% female. The  average UCLA Loneliness Scale score was 42.95 ± 7.77. About 42% of the children  received ≥19 on the depression scale, and 65% of them received ≥40 on the UCLA  Loneliness Scale. Independent variables affecting depression score and UCLA  loneliness score were analysed by a linear regression analysis. The linear  regression model established for depression and UCLA loneliness score was  obtained as statistically significant (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Depression and  loneliness scores were relatively high in children, particularly those exposed to  the devastating impacts of war. These results will make significant contributions  to the planning of services to be provided for this group of children.",May-21,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,e14039,,5,75,,Int J Clin Pract,,,,,,,,eng,© 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,,,,,,Place: India PMID: 33482048,,,,Humans; Female; Male; Child; Adolescent; Depression/epidemiology; *Refugees; Syria; Turkey/epidemiology; Loneliness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A systematic review and meta-regression analysis.,Journal of paediatrics and child health,,1440-1754 1034-4810,10.1111/jpc.14701,,"AIM: Refugees are at increased risk of tuberculosis infection due to time spent in crowded camps, decreased nutrition and originating from countries whose own  tuberculosis control systems may have been disturbed. In Australia, tuberculosis  is screened for in for all refugees aged 11-34 years old and in those aged  2-10 years arriving from high-incidence countries. Our aims were to determine if  refugee children aged under 2 years of age should also be screened. METHODS: A  systematic literature review and meta-regression was carried out on studies in  refugee children under 18 years old, involving screening for tuberculosis (active  or latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI)). Studies were extracted from the last  10 years from a range of bibliographic databases using the search terms  'tuberculosis', 'children', 'screening' and 'refugee', which tested for  tuberculosis using the tuberculin skin test (TST) or QuantiFERON-Gold (Interferon  Gamma Release Assay (IGRA)). RESULTS: Of the 15 included studies, prevalence of  LTBI in < 2-year-olds was 5% using IGRA and 15% using TST (P < 0.05). Prevalence  increased with age (odds ratio 1.12; 95% confidence interval: 1.06-1.17)  cumulatively and decreased where IGRA was used for screening compared to TST  (odds ratio 0.38; 95% confidence interval: 0.25-0.58). Prevalence of LTBI did not  differ between general versus clinic refugee cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Refugees are a  particularly vulnerable group in their susceptibility to tuberculosis, and LTBI  management is a critical part of tuberculosis disease control due to the lifetime  risk of developing active tuberculosis. A prevalence of 5-15% for LTBI in the  under 2 years age group would support them being included in screening  programmes.",Apr-20,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,622-629,,4,56,,J Paediatr Child Health,,,,,,,,eng,© 2019 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (The Royal Australasian College of Physicians).,,,,,,Place: Australia PMID: 31883282,,,,"Humans; Adult; Child; Adolescent; Young Adult; Child, Preschool; Regression Analysis; Australia/epidemiology; child; refugee; *Refugees; screening; Mass Screening; latent tuberculosis; Tuberculin Test; *Latent Tuberculosis/diagnosis/epidemiology; *Tuberculosis/diagnosis/epidemiology",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Refugee children may be  particularly vulnerable due to disruptions in health, well-being, education, and  nutrition during the resettlement process.METHOD To describe the health care  barriers facing refugees in the North Carolina Triangle area (comprised of  Durham, Chapel Hill, Raleigh, and their surrounding areas), we conducted three  focus group interviews (in Arabic, French, and Swahili) with 25 refugee parents  from Syria, Iraq, Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo,  and Chad. We also administered a survey to nine organizations that provide  services for refugees.RESULTS Focus group responses highlighted the  multidimensional nature of health care barriers for refugee families and  children, encompassing challenges with acculturation, communication,  transportation, finances, and health literacy. Organizations emphasized similar  challenges and described their efforts to improve access to services through  increased communication, coordination, and seeking new financial support for  programs.LIMITATIONS Given the geographic focus of the study, results may not be  generalizable to other populations and settings. Men spoke more than women in  some focus groups, and participants may have been influenced by more vocal  contributors. Furthermore, this study is limited by a lack of health outcomes  data.CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that the health care needs of refugees  living in the North Carolina Triangle area can be better met by providing  comprehensive, coordinated, and culturally relevant care.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review is both to summarize  findings regarding the prevalence of mental health disorders among unaccompanied  refugee minors (URM) in European countries since the last available systematic  review (October 2017), and to describe associated risk factors. METHODS: Five  databases were systematically searched for articles published between October 1,  2017 and May 1, 2022. RESULTS: The findings from 23 studies conducted in 9  countries which examined 80,651 child and adolescent URM are explained.  Afghanistan was the most common country of origin in the majority of studies and  >75 % of the subjects were boys. Most of the studies (N = 13, 56.5 %) assessed  posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) prevalence. We found a high prevalence of  mental health disorders among URM children and adolescents, which varied  considerably between studies, ranging from 4.6 % to 43 % for (PTSD), 2.9 % to  61.6 % for depression, 32.6 % to 38.2 % for anxiety and 4 to14.3 % for behavioral  problems. Two studies looking at suicide attempts and deaths, also observed  higher rates in URM compared to the host population of the same age. The studies  looking at mental health risk factors suggest that levels of social support in  the host country, rearing environment, and other factors are associated with  psychopathology. Moreover, a meta-analysis of four studies regarding PTSD in URM  and accompanied refugee minors (ARM) showed a lower prevalence among ARM: -1.14  (95%CI:-1.56-0.72). CONCLUSIONS: PTSD, depression and anxiety are the most  prevalent problems among the URM population in Europe.

Accordingly, their  children are also vulnerable to delayed cognitive and physical development.  OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an  integrated care package in reducing the prevalence of developmental delays among  children aged 1 year and improving their mothers' mental health status. METHODS:  This is a parallel, two-arm, single-blind, cluster randomized controlled trial  (cRCT). A total of 704 mother-child dyads residing at the Kutupalong refugee camp  in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, will be recruited from 22 clusters with 32  mother-child dyads per cluster. In the intervention arm, an integrated early  childhood development and maternal mental health package will be delivered every  quarter to mothers of newborns by trained community health workers until the  child is 1 year old. Our primary outcome is a reduction in the prevalence of two  or more childhood developmental delays of infants aged 1 year compared to the  usual treatment. The secondary outcomes include reduced stunting among children  and the prevalence of maternal depression. We will also assess the  cost-effectiveness of the integrated intervention, and will further explore the  intervention's acceptability and feasibility. RESULTS: At the time of submission,  the study was at the stage of endpoint assessment. The data analysis started in  December 2020, and the results are expected to be published after the first  quarter of 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This study will address the burden of childhood  developmental delays and poor maternal mental health in a low-resource setting.  If proven effective, the delivery of the intervention through community health  workers will ensure the proposed intervention's sustainability.

We evaluated the QOC provided to  malnourished children in West Nile Region in Uganda. DESIGN: Cross-sectional  study. SETTING: West Nile Region, an area hosting over one million refugees.  PARTICIPANTS: Among 148 facilities providing nutritional services, 30 randomly  selected facilities (20%) and the records of 1467 children with severe acute  malnutrition (100% of those attending the 30 facilities during last year) were  assessed. OUTCOMES: The national Nutrition Service Delivery Assessment (NSDA)  tool was used to assess capacity areas related to QOC. Case management, data  quality and health outcomes were assessed from official health records.  Multivariate analysis was performed to explore factors significantly associated  with better cure rates. RESULTS: Of 305 NSDA scores allocated to 30 participating  centres, 201 (65.9%) were 'good' or 'excellent'. However, 20 (66.7%) facilities  had 'poor' 'quality improvement mechanisms' and 13 (43.3%) had 'poor' 'human  resources'. Overall data quality in official records was poor, while recorded  quality of case management was overall fair. Average cure rate was significantly  lower than international Sphere standards (50.4% vs 75% p<0.001) with a higher  default rate (23.2% vs 15% p<0.001). Large heterogeneity among facilities was  detected for all indicators. Refugee-hosting and non-refugee-hosting facilities  had a similar cure rate (47.1% vs 52.1%) though transfer rates were higher for  those hosting refugees (21.5% vs 1.9%, p<0.001) despite better 'equipment and  supplies'. 'Good/excellent' 'equipment' and 'store management' were significantly  associated with better cure rates in outpatient therapeutic centres (+55.9,  p<0.001; +65.4, p=0.041, respectively) in multivariate analysis.

To evaluate the  impact of displacement on nutritional status of Syrian children, this study  describes the prevalence of malnutrition of Syrian children residing in Jordan.  Methods  A retrospective cross-sectional analysis of data from patient  records < 18 years of age from the Syrian American Medical Society's (SAMS)  January 2019 mission trip to Jordan was performed. Prevalence of stunting, severe  wasting, wasting, overweight, and underweight were calculated using the World  Health Organization (WHO) definitions. Results  Overall, 392 Syrian children were  included. In the 0 to 59 months group ( n  = 191), prevalence of stunting was  13.9% ( n  = 165), severe wasting 4.2% ( n  = 165), wasting 6% ( n  = 165),  overweight 16.4% ( n  = 165), and underweight 5.3% ( n  = 190). In the > 59  months group ( n  = 201), prevalence of stunting was 7.2% ( n  = 194), severe  wasting 3.6% ( n  = 194), wasting 5.2% ( n  = 194), overweight 6.7% ( n  = 194),  and underweight 4.6% ( n  = 153).

Conclusion  The findings suggest evidence of higher prevalence of  malnutrition in Syrian children compared with prior assessments and greater  impact on the younger cohort. In 0 to 59 months' old Syrian children, stunting  and wasting were of medium severity and overweight was of high severity. This may  reflect food insecurity in the setting of ongoing conflict, strain on resources,  and evolving refugee policies, acknowledging study limitations.

However, limited attention  has been paid to understanding the social contexts which shape access to abortion  information and services for communities who are less engaged with sexual and  reproductive health care more generally. This paper explores the views and  experiences of 27 migrant and refugee young people (16-24 years old) living in  Sydney, Australia, regarding unintended pregnancy and abortion. Pregnancy outside  marriage was described by all participants as a shameful prospect as it revealed  pre-marital sexual activity. Even when abortion was described as culturally  and/or religiously unacceptable, it was believed many families would find an  abortion preferable to continuing an unintended pregnancy outside marriage.  However, a pervasive culture of silence regarding sexual and reproductive health  may limit access to quality information and support in this area.

METHODS: This qualitative exploratory  study was underpinned by the psychosocial conceptual framework. We undertook  semi-structured interviews with 23 South Sudanese youth aged 14-21 years to  explore attitudes and potential harms of AOD use. We also undertook focus groups  with these participants and a focus group of 11 South Sudanese community elders  and parents. Feedback on results was obtained through two forums with community  members. The data collected were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: The  participants revealed that AOD use was common, specifically the use of cannabis.  The participants believed that there was a lack of basic understanding of the  potential harm of cannabis use. The results also highlighted that the community  was unaware how the use of drugs and alcohol can contribute and exacerbate poor  mental health. Cannabis was a regular drug of choice used by young South Sudanese  in this study. It was used daily as a coping mechanism both for stress and for  undiagnosed mental health. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate  increased potential harm for South Sudanese youth from AOD use. Of concern was a  lack of diagnosis and treatment for mental health wellbeing due to the beliefs  around AOD use. Without targeted interventions this has significant implications  for the South Sudanese community and the young people affected.

This study aimed to build a model of  identity development in an understudied cultural group of trauma-exposed youth  who fled North Korea and resettled in South Korea. METHODS: Sixteen participants  (75% female, M(age) = 26.63 years, M(defection age) = 16.29 years, M(defection  duration) = 5.72 years) produced life-course narratives, as guided by the  life-lines they drew to depict their high and low points and future trajectories.  The cross-sectional qualitative data were analyzed using thematic content  analysis. Themes of identity, trauma, and turning points were derived and coded,  and then organized sequentially to classify stages of identity development.  RESULTS: The Vulnerable stage defined a sense of helplessness during an early  life of deprivation in North Korea. Their identity entered the Invisible stage  during their hiding in China. Upon reaching South Korea, they traversed four  stages: The Renewal stage signaling a fresh outset; the Turmoil stage  characterized by acculturative stress, rejection, and family disruption; the  Achieved stage of relative stability; and the Self-Transcendence stage in which  youth extended beyond their immediate views of self and focused on meaning and  purpose across the themes of social change, reconciliation, and spirituality.  DISCUSSION: The six-stage model of identity development demonstrates that North  Korean youth who defect to South Korea undergo a multifaceted identity  development process as they navigate adversities, interruptions, and turning  points. Results suggest that traumatic experiences can spur positive identity  development and provide implications for professionals working with youth  affected by intense and prolonged social conflict.",Oct-19,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,162-172,,,76,,J Adolesc,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2019 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

4YLC5HDT,journalArticle,2022,"Lin, May",Khmer Girls in Action and healing justice: Expanding understandings of anti-Asian racism and public health solutions.,Frontiers in public health,,2296-2565,10.3389/fpubh.2022.956308,,"This community case study highlights how Khmer Girls in Action (KGA), a Southeast Asian young women-led organizing group in Long Beach, California, enacts healing  justice. Healing justice is a framework for both transforming structures at the  crux of health inequities and healing emotional, spiritual, and psychological  wounds inflicted by structural violence. KGA also anchors the cross-racial and  intersectional Invest in Youth (IIY-LB) coalition. IIY-LB youth leaders have  successfully fought to increase the city's investments in the social determinants  of health, especially young people's well-being. Meanwhile, the coalition has  critiqued over-investments in criminalization and policing as devastating Black,  Brown, queer, low-income, immigrant, and refugee youth and communities. This case  study highlights how KGA's work expands understandings of both anti-Asian racism  and public health solutions in the following ways: First, KGA cultivates youth  leaders' critical analyses to define root causes of health inequities impacting  Southeast Asian refugees as rooted in imperialism, disinvestment, and increased  criminalization. Furthermore, youth leaders come to understand how their  communities' struggles and liberation necessitate intersectional and cross-racial  coalitions. Second, youth leaders forge public health solutions that involve  divesting from criminalization and institutionalizing an Office of Youth  Development, as co-created with young people. Third, KGA and other IIY-LB  organizations cultivate youth's leadership skills and community's political power  to move hearts and minds of decision-makers and community members. For example,  youth leaders have passed a ballot measure funding youth, climate, and health  programs in addition to the city-based Office of Youth Development. Fourth, KGA  engages in a wide range of ""inward"" healing practices to salve wounds caused by  intergenerational trauma. This case study contributes to Asian American health  equity by highlighting the specific importance of organizing, while illuminating  abolitionist perspectives on public health solutions- both of which are  under-discussed in discourse about anti-Asian racism. KGA's work thus illustrates  the importance of centering critical analyses and leadership of communities most  impacted by structural violence in forging transformative public health solutions  to anti-Asian racism.",2022,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,956308,,,10,,Front Public Health,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2022 Lin.,,,,,,Place: Switzerland PMID: 36605235  PMCID: PMC9807656,,,,Humans; Female; Adolescent; Public Health; *Racism; *Asian; anti-Asian racism; Asian People; community organizing; healing justice; health equity; Khmer and Cambodian Americans; Social Justice; Southeast Asian American; young women; youth organizing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite this, there is little research on how best to meet  their needs and in particular what services can mitigate the psychological  difficulties they face. As a result, the evidence base for social services for  refugee children remains very limited. This paper is a systematic review and  meta-analysis of the evidence on the relationship between care placement type and  the educational, mental health and physical health outcomes of unaccompanied  refugee minors. We searched ten databases and identified 3877 citations which  were screened for inclusion. Nine studies were included in the final review, with  seven included in the meta-analysis. Eight studies examined the link between  accommodation type and mental health outcomes, and two analysed the relationship  between accommodation type and education.

Such populations may face vulnerabilities that contribute to the risk of experiencing  violent injury. Youths are at disproportionate risk compared with other age  groups, and such violence may be preventable with appropriately targeted injury  prevention strategies. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of immigrant or  refugee status and immigration-related factors with the experience of assault.  DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This population-based cohort study used linked  health and administrative databases in Ontario, Canada, where health services are  funded through a universal, single-payer health insurance plan. All youths and  young adults aged 10 to 24 years (hereafter referred to as youths) residing in  Ontario from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2016, were eligible to participate.  Data were analyzed from April 13, 2017, to January 6, 2020. EXPOSURES: The main  exposure was immigrant status. Secondary exposures were immigration-related  factors, including visa class, time since immigration, and region and country of  origin. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome consisted of violent  injuries requiring acute care (emergency department visit or hospitalization) or  causing death. Poisson regression models were used to estimate rate ratios for  injuries. RESULTS: A total of 22 969 443 person-years were included in the  analysis (51.3% male and 48.7% female participants). Compared with nonimmigrants,  a greater proportion of immigrants lived in the lowest neighborhood income  quintile (30.5% vs 18.2%) and urban areas (98.9% vs 87.7%). Among immigrants,  17.9% were refugees. Rates of violent injuries experienced were 549.0 (95% CI,  545.7-552.2) per 100 000 person-years in nonimmigrant youth, 225.0 (95% CI,  219.4-230.7) per 100 000 person-years in nonrefugee immigrant youth, and 525.4  (95% CI, 507.2-544.1) per 100 000 person-years in refugee immigrant youth. The  rates of violent injury among nonrefugee and refugee immigrants were lower than  among nonimmigrants (nonrefugee adjusted rate ratio [aRR], 0.41 [95% CI,  0.38-0.43]; refugee aRR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.76-0.89]). Older age (oldest vs youngest  aRR, 6.90 [95% CI, 6.53-7.29]), male sex (aRR, 2.60 [95% CI, 2.52-2.68]), and low  neighborhood income (aRR, 2.42 [95% CI, 2.32-2.53]) were associated with violent  injury risk. Rates of experiencing assault were lowest among South Asian (aRR,  0.33 [95% CI, 0.30-0.37]) and East Asian (aRR, 0.23 [95% CI, 0.19-0.26])  immigrants. Only Somali immigrants experienced higher assault rates (712.0 [95%  CI, 639.3-805.3] per 100 000 person-years) compared with nonimmigrants. Most  injuries (79.9%) were from being struck, followed by being cut (5.9%).  CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The low rates of assault experienced by immigrants,  including refugees, compared with nonimmigrants suggests that Canadian immigrant  settlement supports and cultural factors may be protective against the risk of  experiencing assault.",2020-03-02,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,e200375,,3,3,,JAMA Netw Open,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 32129867  PMCID: PMC7057130,,,,"Humans; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Child; Adolescent; Young Adult; Emigrants and Immigrants/*statistics & numerical data; Cohort Studies; Databases, Factual; Emergency Service, Hospital; Wounds and Injuries/*epidemiology; Ontario; Refugees/*statistics & numerical data; Violence/*statistics & numerical data",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Infectious diarrhea, the most common form of diarrhea  causes substantial morbidity and mortality among children in developing  countries, and the muddled use of antibiotics needs caution due to potential  problems of drug-resistance. The aim of this study is to identify etiologies of  diarrhea and drug susceptibility patterns of bacterial isolates in under-five  children in refugee camps in Gambella Region, Ethiopia. METHODS: An institution-  based matched case control study was conducted using a questionnaire-based  interview from June to December 2017 in Pugnido and Teirkidi refugee camps. Stool  samples were collected and parasites causing diarrhea were identified by wet  mount microscopy. Conventional culture supplemented with API 20E identification  kit was used to identify Salmonella and Shigella species. Antibiotic  susceptibility of bacterial isolates was investigated by using the disk diffusion  method. The association between etiologies and diarrhea was analyzed using  McNemar test or Fisher exact test with 95% confidence interval at a level of  significance of P < 0.05. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of enteric pathogens  were 55 (41.0%) in diarrhea cases and 18 (13.4%) in healthy controls. The  detected etiologies include Giardia lambia (28), Shigella spp. (16), E.  hystolyotica/dispar (13), Ascaris lumbricoides (10), Salmonella spp. (6),  Cryptosporidium parvum (6), Hymenolepis nana (4) and Isospora belli (3). All  isolates were sensitive to kanamycine and ceftazidime. The high resistance rate  was observed against ampicillin (100%), amoxicillin (100%), erythromycin (52%),  chloramphenicol (47.5%), tetracycline (40.5%), cotrimoxazole (34.8%) and  amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (33%). The majorities of the isolates had a low rate  of resistance to ciprofloxacin (8.7%), naldxic acid (8.7%) and amikacin (13%).  CONCLUSIONS: Giardia lamblia, E. Hystolytica/dispar, and Shigella spp are the  common etiologies of diarrhea in children in the studied refugee camps. The study  also showed that significant numbers of bacterial isolates were resistant to the  commonly used antimicrobial drugs. Therefore, improving clinical laboratory  services and promoting evidence-based drug prescription may reinforce proper use  of antibiotics and reduce the emergence of microbial resistance.",2019-11-28,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1008,,1,19,,BMC Infect Dis,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 31779589  PMCID: PMC6883563,,,,"Humans; Prevalence; Female; Male; Child; Adolescent; Surveys and Questionnaires; Child, Preschool; Case-Control Studies; Infant; Refugees; Refugee Camps; Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology; Diarrhea; Ethiopia/epidemiology; Bacteremia/complications/*diagnosis/epidemiology; Diarrhea/*diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology; Drug Resistance, Bacterial/drug effects; Drug susceptibility; Etiologies; Feces/microbiology; Salmonella/isolation & purification; Shigella/isolation & purification; Under-five children",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper presents bone mineral content and vitamin D status data along with  qualitative data that deepen the understanding of newcomer bone health status. A  significantly higher percentage of refugee children (72.3%) had insufficient (<50  nmol/L) or deficient (<30 nmol/L) serum vitamin D compared with immigrants  (53.2%).

Building on theory focused on the developmental competencies of  minority children, the current study used a systematic and novel analytic  approach to disentangle the relationship between income and developmental  outcomes for different groups of migrant children. Utilizing a population-based  cohort of children in British Columbia, Canada (N = 23,154), the study examined  whether income differently predicted the kindergarten to Grade 7 (K-7) literacy  and numeracy trajectories of migrant children (economic, family, and refugee  groups), in comparison to non-migrants. By applying Group-Based Trajectory  Modeling (GBTM), the study found that lower income was generally associated with  lower K-7 literacy and numeracy achievement trajectories. The relationship  between income and achievement did not differ for migrant children in comparison  to non-migrant children, with the exception of one sub-group of high-achieving  economic class migrant children, which appeared to be less impacted by low income  levels. Follow-up binomial logistic regression analysis found that parental  education levels at migration and English language ability predicted which  migrant children would be high literacy and numeracy achievers despite low  income. The results suggest that basic associations between poverty and the  outcomes of migrant children mask an underlying complexity: For most migrant  children, poverty was just as predictive of detrimental academic outcomes as it  was for non-migrant children and being in the exceptional sub-group of  high-achieving, low-income migrant children was partly accounted for by other  protective factors.",Jan-20,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,102344,,,85,,Soc Sci Res,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Previous studies have shown that difficult living  conditions and refugee status alone do not impact the fertility preferences of  Syrian refugees. This study seeks to explore the effect of the overlapping crises  on the fertility preferences and behaviour of Syrian refugees in Lebanon.  METHODS: In this qualitative study, we carried out focus group discussions (FGDs)  with married female Syrian refugees recruited purposively from two cities in West  Bekaa (Bar Elias and Saad Nayel) and from inside and outside the Informal Tented  Settlements (ITS). Transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS:  The overlapping crises (political, economic, and Covid-19) in Lebanon influence  Syrian refugee women's reported desire for fewer children. Two themes emerged  that explained the change in Syrian refugees' fertility preferences towards  limiting their number of children or delaying having children, and potentially a  change in their fertility practices: the sudden deterioration in their living  conditions triggered by the effect of inflation on their daily needs, and  decreased support and changes in the job market that led to more women working to  support their families. Consequently, refugees expressed a preference towards  limiting their number of children due to concern about the consequences of the  crisis on their children's physical and mental well-being. This was combined with  decreased pressure on women from men and in-laws to have (additional) children  and concern over the effect of Covid-19 on pregnant women. CONCLUSIONS: The  sudden deterioration in living conditions due to the overlapping crises may have  influenced Syrian refugees' preferences towards limiting their number of children  or delaying having children until the situation improves. The potential shift in  power dynamics in households caused by more women working outside the home also  may have increased women's autonomy in making decisions regarding family size and  use of modern contraception. These findings have implications for developing  programs that focus on female livelihoods and engagement in work outside the home  to influence family size and other reproductive health outcomes and gender equity  indicators.",2022-06-15,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,35,,1,16,,Confl Health,,,,,,,,eng,© 2022.

Socio-economic deprivation and traumatic experiences  pre-migration contribute to a high risk for mental health problems among  immigrant background youth. Moreover, when adapting to the multi-cultural  contexts of the resettlement countries they face several acculturation demands,  which may also affect their mental health in adaptive or hazardous ways. One of  these acculturation tasks involves developing the cultural competence necessary  to thrive and participate socially within the heritage and the majority cultural  domains. From a public mental health perspective, it is important to have  thorough knowledge about acculturation-related risk and protective factors.  However, this responsibility has been challenged by a lack of acculturation  measures that are theoretically linked to mental health, and target the cultural  competencies of immigrant background youth. Therefore, the current study aimed at  examining if a construct of peer-related culture competence, operationalized in  the Youth Culture Competence Scale (YCCS), captured the same  competence-phenomenon across different language, age, and immigrant groups in two  immigrant-receiving countries. The scale includes two dimensions: one of  heritage, and one of majority peer-related culture competence. METHODS:  Self-report questionnaire data were collected from 895 unaccompanied refugees and  591 immigrant background high school students in Norway, and from 321 immigrant  university students in the United States. To examine if the measure assessed the  same phenomenon of peer-related culture competence across these three  multi-ethnic samples with an age range from 13 to 28, we examined its measurement  equivalence. Additionally, we examined if the association between peer-related  culture competence and depressive symptoms was similar in these groups. RESULTS:  Confirmatory factor analyses supported the proposed two factor structure of the  YCCS across the three samples. The structural equation model assessing the  effects of heritage and majority culture competence on depressive symptoms  confirmed that each culture competence dimension had a unique association with  depressive symptoms across the samples. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the YCCS is  a robust acculturation measure that may be included in public health studies of  mental health among multi-ethnic refugee and immigrant samples of varied ages.",2020-03-06,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,292,,1,20,,BMC Public Health,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 32138713  PMCID: PMC7059687,,,,"Humans; Adult; United States/epidemiology; Female; Male; Acculturation; Adolescent; Self Report; Young Adult; Norway/epidemiology; Youth; Universities; Immigrant; Refugees/*psychology/statistics & numerical data; Schools; Depression/*epidemiology; Emigrants and Immigrants/*psychology/statistics & numerical data; *Cultural Competency; Child, Abandoned/*psychology/statistics & numerical data; Cross-cultural equivalence; Culture competence; Depressive symptoms; Students/psychology/statistics & numerical data; Unaccompanied minor refugees; Young adults",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, despite the  popularity of cortisol as a potential biomarker for stress and adversity,  findings are inconsistent, and little is known about the impact of war-related  trauma on stress physiology of children and adolescents. Here we aimed to  evaluate the relationships between war exposure, current living conditions, hair  cortisol concentrations (HCC) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms  in a large cohort of Syrian refugee children and adolescents (6-18 years) and  their caregiver. This longitudinal observational study assessed Syrian refugee  children and adolescents in two waves, 1 year apart, within informal tented  settlements in Lebanon. The relationships between war exposure, time since  leaving Syria, PTSD symptoms and HCC were investigated using linear mixed-model  regression utilising both waves of data collected (Y1: N = 1574, Y2: N = 923).  Hair cortisol concentration was positively, but weakly associated with the number  of war-related events experienced. This was limited to those who were at least 12  years old at the time of war exposure. Conversely, HCC decreased with time since  leaving Syria. HCC was also associated with PTSD symptoms but not with the  quality of their current living conditions. This study revealed that changes to  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity may accompany both earlier war  exposure and current PTSD symptoms in children and adolescents.

The study also evaluated the applicability of  portable X-ray fluorescence (PXRF) as compared with inductively coupled plasma  mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for mineral profiling of okra powder samples. The  contents of minerals (mg kg(-1)) from the ICP-MS readings were in the following  ranges: K (14,385-33,294), Ca (2610-14,090), P (3178-13,248), Mg (3896-7986), Cu  (3.81-19.3), Fe (75.7-1243), Zn (33-141) and Mn (23.1-261). Regardless of  geographic origin, at low-end consumption probability (17 g day(-1) for young  children and 68 g day(-1) for PLW), okra could contribute ˂ 15% (2.7-12.9%) AI  for macro-minerals (K and Ca).

Refugee children's psychosocial  needs and wellbeing are often overlooked, and post-migration support is of  pivotal importance. METHODS: An easy accessible movement-based psychosocial  intervention, called TeamUp, was developed for children aged 6-17 living in  refugee reception centres. A mixed-method process evaluation was conducted of (1)  implementation process, assessing attendance (n = 2183 children, and n = 209  children); (2) implementation quality, using structured observations at two time  points to evaluate facilitator's (2a) individual-level fidelity (n = 81  facilitators); (2b) team-level fidelity (n = 22 teams); (2c) facilitators'  competencies (n = 81); (2d) trainee perceived self-efficacy pre-post training  (n = 73); and (3) perceptions on implementation and outcomes, employing a survey  (n = 99), focus group discussions and key informant interviews with children  (n = 94), facilitators (n = 24) and reception centre staff (n = 10). RESULTS:  Attendance lists showed a mean of 8.5 children per session, and children  attending 31.3% of sessions.

Surveillance and screening  for developmental concerns in a culturally sensitive manner using evidence-based  tools are cornerstones of early intervention. CONCLUSION: For refugees in  particular, in light of the inequities they have faced before migration and  during their migration trajectory, screening for developmental disabilities and  intervening provides an opportunity to help achieve equitable outcomes for  refugee children and optimize their health and well-being.",Aug-18,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,,567-573,,8,64,,Can Fam Physician,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright© the College of Family Physicians of Canada.,,,,,,Place: Canada PMID: 30108071  PMCID: PMC6189880,,,,Humans; Canada; Cultural Competency; *Emigrants and Immigrants; *Refugees; *Health Services Accessibility; Developmental Disabilities/*diagnosis/*therapy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND:  Available literature on reproductive health of refugee women is mostly from the  healthcare provider perspective, neglecting the lived experience of the  population. DESIGN: Qualitative descriptive. METHODS: A purposive sample of 30  women was recruited for five focus groups. Data were collected via demographic  survey and semi-structured focus group discussion. Content analysis was used to  analyse the data. RESULTS: Our study revealed that Somali Bantu women considered  children as wealth. Reproductive health decision-making was influenced by three  main factors: family influence, cultural/religious ideas and experience with  various hormonal birth control methods. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses and other healthcare  providers would better serve refugee women if equipped with a more nuanced  understanding of factors in their reproductive healthcare decision-making. This  study can inform tailored and cultural relevant interventions to improve  reproductive health among those at greatest need. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE:  Our findings can serve to guide nurses and other healthcare providers' clinical  approach to a subset of the population whose cultural beliefs and practices  regarding reproductive health may be unfamiliar.

This systematic review aims to summarize the current body of evidence for  the prevalence of mental illness in child and adolescent refugee populations.  METHOD: Eight electronic databases, gray literature, and Google Scholar were  searched for articles from 1 January 2003 to 5 February 2018. Strict inclusion  criteria regarding the diagnosis of mental illness were imposed. Study quality  was assessed using a template according to study design, and study heterogeneity  using the I(2) statistic. Random effects meta-analyses results were presented  given heterogeneity among studies. The protocol for this systematic review was  registered with PROSPERO (CRD42016046349). RESULTS: Eight studies were eligible,  involving 779 child and adolescent refugees and asylum seekers, with studies  conducted in 5 countries. The overall prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder  (PTSD) was 22.71% (95% CI 12.79-32.64), depression 13.81% (95% CI 5.96-21.67),  and anxiety disorders 15.77% (95% CI 8.04-23.50). Attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder (ADHD) was 8.6% (1.08-16.12) and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) was  1.69% (95% CI -0.78 to 4.16). Because of the high heterogeneity, further subgroup  analyses were conducted. CONCLUSION: Refugee and asylum seeker children have high  rates of PTSD, depression, and anxiety.

We used in-depth  interviews to examine parents' accounts of how war and refuge gave rise to  different stressors, and how these in turn shaped parenting. We interviewed 27  Syrian refugee parents recently settled in the Netherlands (16 families) twice,  using a grounded theory approach. We distinguished five phases of refuge, namely  prewar, war, flight, displacement, and resettlement. During flight and  displacement, stressors associated with financial and material losses appeared to  induce parental empathy for children's suffering, which seemed to increase  parental leniency. Stressors emerging from family separation during displacement,  however, were reported to burden parents and to lead to uncertainty, which seemed  to compromise parental warmth and sensitive discipline. While narratives suggest  that families reacted in similar ways during the phases of war, flight, and  displacement, differences seemed to emerge during the resettlement phase. Some  parents stated that in resettlement, they experienced post-traumatic growth  (e.g., increased compassion for their children) and were more autonomy supporting  than before the war. Other parents seemed to struggle with accepting and  supporting their children's emotions and appeared to resort more readily to  parental control. Our findings suggest that emotional exhaustion plays a key role  in how parents viewed their parenting changed during refuge, and that individual  differences in parents' abilities to recover from emotional exhaustion played a  key role in shaping parenting in resettlement.",Sep-22,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1248-1263,,3,61,,Fam Process,,,,,,,,eng,© 2021 The Authors.

For children who have been exposed to extreme stress,  such as humanitarian contexts, the need for strong, healthy, nurturing caregiver  relationships may assume even greater importance. Much research has been building  to position family skills interventions as a key tool in encouraging safe and  supporting relationships between caregivers and children, thus preventing many  problem behaviours and poor mental health. While there is substantial evidence of  the effectiveness of family skills interventions in high-income and stable  contexts, evidence of interventions that have been tested in humanitarian and  challenging settings, such as contexts of refugee and displacement, are far  fewer. Despite the role that family skills interventions can play in protecting  children from current and future challenges, there is a significant lack of such  interventions being utilised in humanitarian settings. We put forward seven  likely reasons for this lack of uptake. Furthermore, the Strong Families  programme, a UNODC family skills intervention, is presented as an example of an  intervention that aims to bridge this gap of interventions that meet the need for  humanitarian and contexts of extreme stress.

DESIGN: This cross-sectional, observational study involving individual and  geographic-level data used multilevel models to estimate associations between  neighbourhood food environment and child outcomes. Interactions between HFI and  NFE were employed to determine whether HFI moderated the association between NFE  and child outcomes and whether the associations differed for US-born v.  immigrant/refugee groups. SETTING: The sample resided in 367 census tracts in the  Minneapolis/St. Paul, MN metropolitan area, and the data were collected in  2016-2019. PARTICIPANTS: The sample was from the Family Matters study of families  (n 1296) with children from six racial/ethnic and immigrant/refugee groups  (African American, Latino, Hmong, Native American, Somali/Ethiopian and White).  RESULTS: Living in a neighbourhood with low perceived access to affordable fresh  fruits and vegetables was found to be associated with lower food security (P <  0·01), poorer child diet quality (P < 0·01) and reduced availability of a variety  of fruits (P < 0·01), vegetables (P < 0·05) and whole grains in the home (P <  0·01). Moreover, residing in a food desert was found to be associated with a  higher child BMI percentile if the child's household was food insecure (P <  0·05). No differences in associations were found for immigrant/refugee groups.  CONCLUSIONS: Poor NFE were associated with worse weight-related outcomes for  children; the association with weight was more pronounced among children with  HFI.

There is a need to explore how  healthcare providers, in the absence of vaccine documentation, determine the  vaccination needs of newly arrived refugee children. METHODS: To explore the  tactics employed by healthcare professionals who screen and vaccinate  asylum-seeking children in Denmark, we conducted semi-structured interviews  between December 2015 and January 2016 with six healthcare professionals,  including three doctors and three public health nurses. The interviews were  digitally recorded, transcribed and subjected to a thematic network analysis.  RESULTS: The analysis revealed that healthcare providers adopt a number of  tactics to ascertain children's immunization needs. They ask into the children's  vaccination history through the use of qualified interpreters; consult WHO lists  of immunization programmes worldwide; draw on tacit knowledge about country  vaccination programmes; consider the background of parents; err on the side of  caution and revaccinate. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first studies to  demonstrate the tactics employed by healthcare providers to ascertain the  immunization needs of asylum-seeking children in a western receiving country. The  findings suggest a need for clear guidance at a national level on how to  determine the vaccination needs of asylum-seeking children, and an international  effort to secure reliable immunization documentation for migrant populations, for  example through virtual immunization records.",2018-11-14,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,859,,1,18,,BMC Health Serv Res,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 30428869  PMCID: PMC6236986,,,,"Humans; Female; Qualitative Research; Male; Middle Aged; Aged; Child; Needs Assessment; Adolescent; Child, Preschool; Denmark; Infant; Referral and Consultation; Parents; Immunization; Refugee children; Vaccination; Refugees/*statistics & numerical data; Asylum-seeking children; *Vaccination; Allied Health Personnel/organization & administration; Health Personnel/*organization & administration; Healthcare workers; Professional Practice/*organization & administration; Tactics; Vaccines",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Four hundred  Rohingya women were interviewed. Data were collected using a structured and  pretested questionnaire, which included study participants' socio-demographic  characteristics, access to FP services, knowledge, attitude, and practice of FP.  Linear regression analysis was performed to identify the influencing factors of  FP-KAP. RESULTS: Of the 400 Rohingya refugee women, 60% were unaware that there  was no physical harm brought by using a permanent method of birth control. Half  of the women lack proper knowledge regarding whether a girl was eligible for  marriage before the age of 18. More than two-thirds of the women thought family  planning methods should not be used without the husband's permission. Moreover,  40% were ashamed and afraid to discuss family planning matters with their  husbands. Of the study participants, 58% had the opinion that a couple should  continue bearing children until a son is born. Linear regression analyses found  that study participants' who have a profession, have less children, whose primary  source of FP knowledge was through a physician/nurse, have had FP interventions  in the camp, and talk with a health care provider on FP were found to have better  FP-KAP. CONCLUSION: The study showed that Rohingya refugee women are a  marginalized population in terms of family planning and their comprehensive  FP-KAP capability was low. Contraceptives among the Rohingyas were unpopular,  mainly due to a lack of educational qualifications and family planning awareness.  In addition, family planning initiatives among Rohingya refugees were limited by  a conservative culture and religious beliefs.

In Lebanon, the state's political agenda  influences laws and policies that restrict or encourage women's procreation,  depending on their nationality, sect, marital, and legal status. Since 1943,  Lebanon's system of proportionally allocating parliamentary seats to sectarian  political parties, based on their population size, has spurred fears of  demographic changes across sects. This fear is also referenced by politicians as  the reason why Lebanese women are legally denied their rights of passing  citizenship on to their children and non-Lebanese spouses. With Lebanon holding  the highest refugee population per capita in the world, the fear of disturbing  the ""sectarian balance"" directly collides with the reproductive autonomy of both  Syrian and Palestinian refugee women. Migrant women living in Lebanon are also  restricted to playing out their role as workers and therefore have their sexual  and reproductive health and rights denied. Another fear of the state is that of  changing moral values, whereby motherhood and parenthood in single women, queer,  transgender, and intersex persons are perceived as deviant and a threat to  traditional values. This review aims to display how, through fear - of changing  moral values and demographic shifts - the Lebanese state practices reproductive  oppression on part of the population, while neglecting them and exacerbating  their difficult living conditions.",May-19,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,12-Jan,,2,27,,Sex Reprod Health Matters,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 31533595  PMCID: PMC7888101,,,,Humans; Female; Ethnicity; Mothers; refugee; *Refugees; Syria; *Transients and Migrants; Lebanon; women; Demography; motherhood; *Politics; *Women's Rights; citizenship; Morals; Pakistan; queer; Reproduction; reproductive justice; Social Change; transgender,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to identify  risk and protective factors influencing Somali American adolescent tobacco use  decision making and potential family and community roles in tobacco prevention.  METHOD: We conducted 15 semistructured, in-depth interviews with 12 Somali and 3  non-Somali professionals serving Minnesotan metropolitan Somali communities in  clinical, educational, religious, and other community organizations. Grounded  Theory informed our data collection and analysis. RESULTS: Key informants cited  three major influences on Somali adolescent tobacco use: evolving norms and  increasing exposure to tobacco products in the United States, low risks  perception, especially for waterpipes, and conflicting interpretations of faith.  Informants highlighted the important roles of families in Somali youth tobacco  prevention while acknowledging areas where families would benefit from greater  support. Proposed sources of support included faith communities and nonparental,  ethnically similar adult mentors. Informants acknowledged challenges to  addressing youth tobacco prevention in clinics and underscored the importance of  youth involvement in developing prevention strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Our results  indicate Somali adolescent tobacco prevention efforts should address the evolving  tobacco use exposures and norms, low risk perceptions, and clarify faith  messaging.

Treatment with  oral antifungals is usually withheld until mycology results are available. In  Israel, African refugee children demonstrate higher susceptibility to Tinea  capitis and generally fail to undergo follow-up evaluations. METHODS: This study  aimed to identify the clinical characteristics and treatment responses of refugee  children in Israel with Tinea capitis, in order to formulate a treatment plan for  primary care physicians. To this end, demographic, clinical and laboratory data  were extracted from the electronic medical records of 76 refugee children  presenting with Tinea capitis during 2016-2017. All measured variables and  derived parameters are presented using descriptive statistics. The correlation  between background clinical and demographic data and Tinea capitis diagnosis was  assessed using the chi-squared and Wilcoxon tests. Correlations between  demographic/clinical/laboratory characteristics and other types of fungi or other  important findings were assessed using a T-test. RESULTS: Scaling was the most  common clinical finding. Cultures were positive in 64 (84%) and direct  examination in 65 (85%) cases, with a positive correlation between the methods in  75% of cases. The most common fungal strain was T. violaceum. Fluconazole  treatment failed in 27% of cases. Griseofulvin 50 mg/kg/day was administered to  74 (97%) children, and induced clinical responses. No side effects were reported.  CONCLUSIONS: The key aim of this study was to emphasize the importance of  diagnosis and treatment of these immigrant children by their primary pediatric  doctor since it takes, an average of 4.3 months until they visit a dermatologist.  During this critical time period, the scalp can become severely and permanently  damaged, and the infection can become systemic or cause an outbreak within the  entire community.

We  utilized the framework of Basic Psychological Needs Theory (Deci & Ryan, 2000)  which proposes that competence, relatedness, and autonomy are universal  psychological needs. We examined the challenges to meeting these needs and  resolutions to these challenges. Integral to understanding these needs was to  place them in the context of a bicultural model of adaptation. Of particular  interest was discovering how these young people negotiate and reconcile home and  host cultural demands while meeting needs. METHOD: From July 2019 to August 2020,  semistructured individual interviews (N = 44) were completed with youth, parents,  and cultural experts. Data were analyzed using a hybrid inductive and deductive  approach and thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Active engagement, assertion,  and self-advocacy were delineated as important pathways to achieve competence.  Relatedness needs were served by inclusive ties, and frequently included other  ""outsiders."" Autonomy came from self-sufficiency, agency, and ""voice."" Altruism  was common, extending beyond ethnic community, and promoted competence,  relatedness, and empowerment. Conflicts between family and host culture were  managed by accepting parental authority. Parents contributed to integrating home  and host cultures by flexibly interpreting traditional rules. CONCLUSIONS: Our  findings illustrate the strengths of these youth who manage tremendous challenges  to meeting their psychological needs. We highlight how in the process of cultural  adaptation they retain ties to their home culture. They choose diversity in their  relationships and find agency and purpose by supporting others.

Nearly 450,000 migrant and new-born children live  in the camps in already stressed conditions. The occurrence of elevated Mn  concentrations in groundwater in the camps and their adjacent areas is likely an  additional stressor exposing these children to an increased risk of  neurotoxicity. Based on the results of this small-scale study, we recommend  undertaking an in-depth study on the occurrence of Mn in groundwater in the camps  to come up with appropriate strategies to minimise exposure.

CASE PRESENTATION: This study used a community-based system dynamics approach to  understand key stakeholders' perspectives of the drivers and effects of inclusion  and wellbeing for children with disabilities, and to elicit recommendations to  enhance educational inclusion in a refugee camp in Eastern Africa.  Community-based system dynamics sessions, designed based on group model building  scripts and facilitated by a team of four people, took place with organization  staff, community leaders, and parents and caregivers of children with  disabilities. The process produced a causal loop diagram depicting the  stakeholders' perspectives of how multiple components interact in a system to  drive inclusion and wellbeing of children with disabilities over time.  CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate participants have a broad conceptualization of  inclusion, highlighting the value of community interaction and importance of  meeting basic needs, and also demonstrate that including children in mainstream  educational settings in a complex humanitarian context requires a more nuanced  approach given the lack of existing resources to support Western models of  educational inclusion fully.",2021-07-23,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,58,,1,15,,Confl Health,,,,,,,,eng,© 2021.

AIMS: This study aims to  explore potential risk and protective factors for comorbid depression-anxiety and  comorbid depression-PTSD by examining associations between trauma exposure,  psychosocial factors, and mental health symptoms among a sample of Somali  refugees displaced in urban Kenya. METHODS: We used snowball sampling to recruit  Somali youth aged 15 to 35years(N = 250,n = 143 female, n = 88 male, n = 19  unknown gender). We measured 16 common types of trauma exposure and three  psychosocial factors (endorsing violence, willingness to share problems, and  symptom awareness) and used the HSCL-25 and PCL-C to capture individual and  comorbid CMD symptoms, using guided cutoff points and/or algorithms. We then ran  a series of logistic regression analyses to examine relationships between trauma  exposure, psychosocial factors, and individual and comorbid CMD symptoms.  RESULTS: Findings showed that increased trauma exposure predicted symptoms of  individual and comorbid CMDs. Increased symptom awareness and endorsement of  violence predicted comorbid depression-PTSD and comorbid anxiety-depression  symptoms, respectively. Willingness to share problems buffered depressive  symptoms but did not predict comorbidity.

This report describes IMD incidence at mass gatherings over the  past 10 years and discusses strategies to prevent IMD at such events. METHODS: A  PubMed search was conducted in December 2018 using a search string intended to  identify articles describing IMD at mass gatherings, including religious  pilgrimages, sports events, jamborees, and refugee camps. The search was limited  to articles in English published from 2008 to 2018. Articles were included if  they described IMD incidence at a mass gathering event. RESULTS: A total of 127  articles were retrieved, of which 7 reported on IMD incidence at mass gatherings  in the past 10 years. Specifically, in Saudi Arabia between 2002 and 2011, IMD  occurred in 16 Hajj pilgrims and 1 Umrah pilgrim; serotypes involved were not  reported. At a youth sports festival in Spain in 2008, 1 case of serogroup B IMD  was reported among 1500 attendees. At the 2015 World Scout Jamboree in Japan, an  outbreak of serogroup W IMD was identified in five scouts and one parent. At a  refugee camp in Turkey, one case of serogroup B IMD was reported in a Syrian  girl; four cases of serogroup X IMD occurred in an Italian refugee camp among  refugees from Africa and Bangladesh. In 2017, a funeral in Liberia resulted in 13  identified cases of serogroup C IMD. Requiring meningococcal vaccination for mass  gathering attendees and vaccinating refugees might have prevented these IMD  cases.

RESULTS: Only 4.8% children aged 0-<2 years and 7.3% children aged >2-16 years  screened positive for NDDs, comparable with a local Bangladesh population.  However, 52% of children were in the abnormal range for emotional symptoms on the  SDQ, and 25% abnormal for peer problems.

RESULTS: In this cohort, 37%  of bereaved refugees reported probable prolonged grief disorder. Path analysis  indicated that caregivers' grief was directly associated with children's  emotional difficulties. Caregiver warmth was associated with reduced emotional  problems in children of refugees with minimal grief but associated with more  emotional problems in caregivers with more severe grief. More harsh parenting was  associated with children's conduct problems, and this was more evident in those  with less severe grief.

This cross-sectional study aimed to explore the oral  hygiene status and prevalence of caries, and to investigate their association  with malocclusion characteristics in a child refugee population. METHODS: 606  Syrian refugee children and adolescents aged 7-19 years, registered as refugees  in Jordan and residing in Zaatari camp, were recruited to the study. Oral hygiene  and caries status were recorded using DMFT (mean of decayed, missing, and filled  permanent teeth) and OHI-S (Simplified Oral Hygiene Index) according to WHO  criteria. Oral health results were then cross tabulated with previously reported  malocclusion traits for the same study sample (crowding, spacing, contact point  deflection and IOTN) to detect any associations. Statistical analysis was  conducted using chi-square test, independent sample t-test, one-way ANOVA, Welch  test and Post Hoc testing (Gabriel and Games-Howell). RESULTS: Overall DMFT and  OHI-S were 4.32 and 1.33 respectively with no difference between males and  females. Around 40% of the sample showed ≥ 5 DMFT score. 96.1% of the sample  either do not brush or brush occasionally: females showed better oral hygiene  practices (P = 0.002).

Subjects with  malocclusion, specifically crowding, contact point deflection and IOTN grades 3,  4 and 5 had higher scores in both arches for OHI-S and DMFT than subjects without  malocclusion traits, although this was not statistically significant for DMFT  scores. Overall, patients with generalized spacing had a significantly lower  OHI-S score than those without spacing (P = 0.021). Significant correlations were  found between parameters of intra-arch and inter-arch relationships and oral  health indices (DMFT and OHI-S).

Predictors were contextual variables in terms of  the asylum-process, acculturation variables in terms of bicultural identity, and  demographic information such as residence-time. METHOD: Register data and  cross-sectional self-report questionnaire data were collected from 895  unaccompanied young refugees (UYRs). They originated in 31 different countries,  the majority was from Afghanistan, 82.4% were boys, and average residence-time  was 2.5 years. RESULTS: The length of the asylum-process was not associated with  depression while heritage identity and residence-time were. Moderating analyses  showed that an over-time steady decrease in depression was present for UYRs with  a strong heritage identity. The prevalence of depression symptoms dropped from an  initial 40%-14% among youth with 10 years of residence. Majority identity had  neither direct nor indirect effects on depression. CONCLUSION: To optimize the  psychosocial support offered to unaccompanied refugee minors during transition to  stable resettlement, we need more substantial information about the aspects of  the asylum-seeking process that increase the risk for mental health problems  among them. In the years following resettlement, a strong heritage, but not  majority identity was associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms. The  findings are discussed in relation to structural barriers to bicultural identity  formation and integration embedded in the way psychosocial support and education  for these youths are structured, and implication for future research.",Dec-20,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,59-69,,,85,,J Adolesc,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2020 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

Given the lack of information on  anemia design effects (DEFF) observed in surveys in these settings, the goal of  this paper is to better understand the magnitude and distribution of DEFFs and  intracluster correlation coefficients (ICCs) in order to inform future survey  design. METHODS: Two-stage cluster surveys conducted during 2013-2016 were  included if they measured hemoglobin in refugee children aged 6-59 months and/or  non-pregnant women aged 15-49 years. Prevalence of anemia, anemia DEFFs and ICCs,  mean cluster size, number of clusters, and total sample size were calculated  per-survey for non-pregnant women and children. Non-parametric tests were used to  assess differences and correlations of ICC and DEFF between women and children  and inter-regional differences. RESULTS: Eighty-seven unique cluster surveys from  nine countries were included in this analysis. More than 90% of all surveys had  ICC values for anemia below 0.10. Median ICC for children was 0.032 (IQR:  0.015-0.048), not significantly different from that observed for non-pregnant  women for whom the median was 0.024 (IQR: -0.002-0.055). DEFFs were significantly  higher for children [1.54 (IQR: 1.21-1.82)] versus women [1.20 (IQR: 0.99-1.46)].  Regional differences in DEFFs and ICCs were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Both ICCs and  DEFF were relatively small for both non-pregnant women and preschool children and  fall in a narrow range. Differences in ICCs between women and children were  non-significant, suggesting similar inter-cluster distributions of anemia;  significant differences in DEFF were likely attributable to differing cluster  sizes. Given regional differences in both ICCs and DEFFs, location-specific  values are preferred. However, in the absence of other context-specific  information, we suggest using DEFFs of 1.4-1.8 if mean cluster size is around 20,  and DEFFs of 1.2-1.4 if mean cluster size is around 10.",2021,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,e0254031,,7,16,,PLoS One,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 34264944  PMCID: PMC8282045,,,,"Humans; Adult; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Nutrition Surveys; Child, Preschool; Infant; Refugees; *Anemia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN:  Convergence triangulation mixed-methods study design. Associations were examined  between receiving the school feeding intervention and children's outcomes using  multivariable regression models. Quantitative data were complemented with  interviews and focus group discussions with parents and staff. SETTING: In  vulnerable communities in Lebanon, the World Food Programme has implemented an  emergency SFP targeting Lebanese (attending morning sessions) and Syrian refugee  children (attending afternoon sessions) in public schools. PARTICIPANTS: Children  from ten intervention schools (morning n 403; afternoon n 379) and ten matched  control schools (morning n 399; afternoon n 401), as well as twenty-nine parents  and twenty-two school staff members. RESULTS: Diet diversity was higher in  intervention schools as compared with control with a significantly higher  consumption of dairy products, nuts and fruit in both sessions. Child-reported  food insecurity experience was lower in children attending the afternoon session  of intervention v. control schools. The SFP intervention was associated with  higher school engagement and sense of school community in the morning session  only. While the SFP was significantly associated with higher attendance for  children in afternoon sessions only, it was significantly associated with school  retention of children in both sessions.

Discrimination was not mediated by family  functioning, rather it exerted a direct effect on substance use norms (β = 0.20,  p < .01) and intentions (β = 0.33, p < .001).

D.",Protocol for a randomized control trial of the caregiver support intervention with Syrian refugees in Lebanon.,Trials,,1745-6215,10.1186/s13063-020-4175-9,,"BACKGROUND: There is evidence that chronic stress negatively impacts parenting among refugees and other war-affected communities. Persistent parental stress and  distress may lead to unresponsive, anxious, or overly harsh parenting and a  corresponding increase in emotional and behavior problems among children. Most  parenting interventions emphasize the acquisition of knowledge and skills;  however, this overlooks the deleterious effects of chronic stress on parenting.  The Caregiver Support Intervention (CSI) aims to strengthen quality of parenting  skills by lowering stress and improving psychosocial wellbeing among refugee  caregivers of children aged 3-12 years, while also increasing knowledge and  skills related to positive parenting. The CSI is a nine-session psychosocial  group intervention delivered by non-specialist providers. It is intended for all  adult primary caregivers of children in high-adversity communities, rather than  specifically targeting caregivers already showing signs of elevated distress.  METHODS/DESIGN: The primary objective of this study is to assess the  effectiveness of the CSI through a parallel group randomized controlled study  with Syrian refugee families in North Lebanon. Participants will be primary  caregivers of children aged 3-12 years, with one index child per family. Families  will be randomized to the CSI or a waitlist control group. A total of 240  families (480 caregivers) will be recruited into the study. Randomization will be  at the family level, and CSI groups will be held separately for women and men.  The study will be implemented in two waves. Outcomes for both arms will be  assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and at a 3-month follow-up. The primary  outcome is quality of parenting skills. Secondary outcomes include parental  warmth and sensitivity, harsh parenting, parenting knowledge, and child  psychosocial wellbeing. Putative mediators of the CSI on parenting are caregiver  stress, distress, psychosocial wellbeing, and stress management. DISCUSSION: This  trial may establish the CSI as an effective intervention for strengthening  parenting in families living in settings of high adversity, particularly refugee  communities.

The latest  political crises and war have led to an upsurge in refugee movements into  European countries, giving rise to a re-evaluation of the epidemiology of  psychiatric disorders and mental health problems among young refugees and asylum  seekers. We systematically searched five electronic databases and reference lists  of pertinent review articles. We then screened the results of forward citation  tracking of key articles for relevant studies in the field for the period from  January 1990 to October 2017. We dually reviewed citations and assessed risk of  bias. We reported the results narratively, as meta-analyses were impeded due to  high heterogeneity. We included 47 studies covered in 53 articles. Overall, the  point prevalence of the investigated psychiatric disorders and mental health  problems varied widely among studies (presenting interquartile ranges): for  posttraumatic stress disorder between 19.0 and 52.7%, for depression between 10.3  and 32.8%, for anxiety disorders between 8.7 and 31.6%, and for emotional and  behavioural problems between 19.8 and 35.0%. The highly heterogeneous evidence  base could be improved by international, methodologically comparable studies with  sufficiently large sample sizes drawn randomly among specific refugee  populations. The prevalence estimates suggest, nevertheless, that specialized  mental health care services for the most vulnerable refugee and asylum-seeking  populations are needed.

There is a lack of evidence of impact of these  interventions with respect to both short-term outcomes and longer-term  developmental trajectories. METHODS: We collected data from caregivers of  Congolese refugee children residing in Rwamwanja Refugee Settlement at three  timepoints. To assess short-term impact of CFSs, we compared indicators assessed  shortly after refugees' arrival (baseline, T1) and endline (T2, three to six  months after CFS implementation) amongst 430 CFS attenders and 161 nonattenders.  Follow-up assessments after the end of CFS programming were conducted 18 months  post-baseline (T3) with caregivers of 249 previous CFS attenders and 77 CFS  nonattenders. RESULTS: In the short-term, attendance at CFSs was associated with  better maintenance of psychosocial well-being (PSWB; β = 2.093, p < .001, Cohen's  d = .347) and greater increases in developmental assets (β = 2.517, p < .001,  Cohen's d = .231), with significantly stronger impacts for girls. CFS  interventions meeting higher programing quality criteria were associated with  greater impact on both PSWB and development assets (β = 2.603 vs. β = 1.793 and  β = 2.942 vs. β = 2.337 for attenders at higher and lower-quality CFSs c.f.  nonattenders, respectively).

At follow-up, however, there were no discernable impacts of prior CFS  attendance on any measures. Age and school attendance were the only  characteristics that predicted an outcome - developmental assets - at follow-up.  CONCLUSIONS: Attendance at CFSs - particularly involving higher-quality  programming - supported children's well-being and development.

A research area in need of further high-quality evaluation, including  RCTs, is school-based mental health interventions for refugee children and  adolescents. However, engaging schools with interventions and associated  evaluations can be challenging. This paper explores the application of  behavioural insights, i.e. evidence-based understanding of how people behave and  make decisions, to RCT recruitment at the school level via email communications.  A pilot study of applying behavioural insights to mail outs attempting to recruit  schools to a RCT of a trauma-focused group intervention for refugee children and  adolescents experiencing symptoms of post-traumatic stress is reported. Rates of  school involvement between the behavioural insights approach (n = 31) and a  standard outreach approach (n = 65) are compared. RESULTS: Schools were more  likely to give a positive response to the mail out designed using the behavioural  insights framework than standard outreach.

The identification of malaria infection status in the  refugee settlements is useful in treating infected persons and in developing  malaria prevention recommendations. Assays for Plasmodium antigens and human IgG  against Plasmodium parasites can be used as indicators to determine malaria  infection status and exposure. METHODS: Dried blood spot (DBS) samples (N = 1239)  from a household survey performed April-May 2018 in three settlements in Cox's  Bazar district, Bangladesh were utilized for a sample population of children from  ages 1-14 years of age. The samples were tested using a bead-based multiplex  antigen assay for presence of the pan-Plasmodium antigen aldolase as well as  Plasmodium falciparum histidine rich protein 2 (HRP2). A bead-based multiplex  assay was also used to measure human IgG antibody response to P. falciparum,  Plasmodium malariae, and Plasmodium vivax merozoite surface protein 1 antigen  (MSP1) isoforms, and P. falciparum antigens LSA1, CSP, and GLURP-R0. RESULTS:  There were no detectable Plasmodium antigens in any samples, suggesting no active  malaria parasite infections in the tested children. IgG seroprevalence was  highest to P. vivax (3.1%), but this was not significantly different from the  percentages of children antibody responses to P. falciparum (2.1%) and P.  malariae (1.8%). The likelihood of an anti-Plasmodium IgG response increased with  age for all three malaria species. Evidence of exposure to any malaria species  was highest for children residing 8-10 months in the settlements, and was lower  for children arriving before and after this period of time. CONCLUSIONS: Absence  of Plasmodium antigen in this population provides evidence that children in these  three Bangladeshi refugee settlements did not have malaria at time of sampling.  Higher rates of anti-malarial IgG carriage from children who were leaving Myanmar  during the malaria high-transmission season indicate these migrant populations  were likely at increased risk of malaria exposure during their transit.",2020-03-30,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,130,,1,19,,Malar J,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 32228699  PMCID: PMC7106647,,,,"Humans; Prevalence; Child; Adolescent; Ethnicity/statistics & numerical data; Child, Preschool; Infant; Bangladesh/epidemiology; Myanmar/ethnology; Refugees/statistics & numerical data; Antibodies, Protozoan/*isolation & purification; Antigen detection; Antigens, Protozoan/*isolation & purification; Fructose-Bisphosphate Aldolase/*isolation & purification; Immunoglobulin G/*isolation & purification; Malaria; Malaria/epidemiology; Multiplex serology; P. falciparum; P. malariae; P. vivax; Plasmodium falciparum/*isolation & purification; Plasmodium malariae/*isolation & purification; Plasmodium vivax/*isolation & purification; Protozoan Proteins/*isolation & purification; Seroepidemiologic Studies",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This is a  cross-sectional study conducted on 129 Syrian refugee families living in Lebanon  during the COVID-19 pandemic. All participants provided consent prior to  completion of the standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: During the pandemic, 79%  of breadwinners lost their jobs; of those who kept their jobs, 68% had their  wages reduced. None of the families was capable of affording all of their basic  needs with 55% only partially affording and 45% not able to afford.

Different themes were developed from the  data: active living, balance, body talk, challenges, environment and health,  culture and health, family, health and food, health and safety, knowledge, source  of knowledge, peers and friends, personal hygiene, recreational activities,  socio-emotional health, social isolation and spiritual health. Excerpts were  taken from the different themes to demonstrate the immigrant/refugee youths'  understanding of levels of health literacy and its contribution to healthy eating  and active living. The qualitative findings are presented under the different  tenets of health literacy. Health literacy extends beyond the individual level  and effects the whole family and communities; intervention need to extend to  include community connections and involvement activities. Future research needs  to focus on the long-term effects of critical health literacy among immigrant  communities.",2021-04-15,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,406-416,,2,36,,Health Promot Int,,,,,,,,eng,"© The Author(s) 2020.

In this study,  extra and intra-oral features of malocclusion and the dental health component of  the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN) were reported. METHODS:  Examination of 606 Syrian children/adolescents refugees attending Zaatari clinic  was carried out (males = 280, females = 326, mean age = 11.84 ± 2.1 years).  Subjects not within the age limit, with a history of orthodontic treatment, or  with craniofacial anomalies were excluded. Both extra and intra-oral features of  malocclusion were assessed. Intra-oral features included inter- and intra-arch  occlusal characteristics: crowding, spacing, crossbite, overjet, overbite, molar  and canine relationship, incisor relationship, and centerline shift. In addition,  the dental health component (DHC) of the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need  (IOTN) was recorded. Gender and age variations in malocclusion characteristics  and IOTN grading were tested using chi-square and nonparametric tests  respectively (P < 0.05). RESULTS: The prevalence of malocclusion was 83.8% (52.6%  class I, 24.2% class II, 7% class III). The most common features of malocclusion  were crowding (71.1%) followed by centerline shift (52.1%), increased overjet  (36.1%), high vertical proportions (34%) and deep overbite (31.2%); there were  significant gender and age differences for a number of occlusal traits. The  prevalence of moderate to severe need for orthodontic treatment was 67.7%.  CONCLUSIONS: This study provides baseline data on the prevalence of malocclusion  in Syrian refugee children/adolescents in Zaatari camp where data concerning oral  health of this population are lacking. The prevalence of orthodontic treatment  need was high warranting the need for a comprehensive interceptive orthodontic  program to prevent increasing oral health problems in the future. This high  burden of oral diseases has a negative financial impact on the hosting country  which can be reduced through public health interventions and implementing  community-based dental healthcare for this underprivileged population.",2021-06-14,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,305,,1,21,,BMC Oral Health,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 34126987  PMCID: PMC8204474,,,,Humans; Prevalence; Female; Cross-Sectional Studies; Male; Child; Adolescent; Refugee; *Refugees; Syria/epidemiology; *Malocclusion/epidemiology; Malocclusion; Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need; IOTN/DHC; Orthodontic treatment need,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study is to increase our knowledge about possible pathways to well-being and  integration for unaccompanied refugee minors as they strive to establish new  lives in a host county. The present study followed a group of youth who fled to  Norway without their caregivers at three time points; 6 months (n = 95; M  age = 13.8, 80% boys), 2 years (n = 78; M age = 16.5, 83% boys), and 5 years  (n = 47; M age 20.0, 83% boys) after arrival. Linear mixed effects models were  used to assess whether age, gender, and trauma exposure prior to arrival were  associated with levels and changes in symptoms of posttraumatic stress (PTS),  depression, anxiety, and externalizing symptoms over time. Regression analyses  were conducted to examine whether daily hassles, perceived social support, and  new trauma experiences predict PTS, internalization, externalization, and  somatization. The mean levels of depression had decreased significantly at  5 years, but mean levels of anxiety, PTS, and externalizing symptoms did not.  Females and severely trauma exposed had higher levels of symptoms. Higher age was  associated with less change in symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress  over time. Five years after arrival, many still experienced clinical levels of  mental health problems, and level of daily hassles was an important predictor.  Support may be needed not only at arrival to handle mental health problems in  general and posttraumatic stress in particular, but also after resettlement.

Therefore, to  identify and address health concerns early, the US Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention (CDC) recommends a domestic medical examination (screening for  infectious and noninfectious diseases/conditions) shortly after arrival in the  US. However, because refugee/migrant populations often have differing health  patterns from one another and the US population, the collection and analysis of  health information is key to developing population-specific clinical guidelines  to guide the care of resettled individuals. Yet little is known regarding the  health status of Cubans resettling in the US. Among the tens of thousands of  Cuban migrants who have resettled in the US, some applied as refugees in Cuba,  some applied for parole (a term used to indicate temporary US admission status  for urgent humanitarian reasons or reasons of public benefit under US immigration  law) in Cuba, and others applied for parole status after crossing the border.  These groups were eligible for US government benefits to help them resettle,  including a domestic medical examination. We reviewed health differences found in  these examinations of those who were determined to be refugees or parolees in  Cuba and those who were given parole status after arrival. METHODS AND FINDINGS:  We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of the Texas Department of  State Health Services database. Cubans who arrived from 2010 to 2015 and received  a domestic medical examination in Texas were included. Those granted  refugee/parolee status in Cuba were listed in federal databases for US-bound  refugees/parolees; those who were paroled after arrival were not listed. Overall,  2,189 (20%) obtained either refugee or parolee status in Cuba, and 8,709 (80%)  received parolee status after arrival. Approximately 62% of those who received  parolee status after arrival at the border were male, compared with 49% of those  who obtained prior refugee/parolee status in Cuba. Approximately one-half (45%)  of those paroled after arrival were 19-34 years old (versus 26% among those who  obtained refugee/parolee status in Cuba). Separate models were created for each  screening indicator as the outcome, with entry route as the main exposure  variable. Crude and adjusted prevalence ratios were estimated using PROC GENMOD  procedures in SAS 9.4. Individuals paroled after arrival were less likely to  screen positive for parasitic infections (9.6% versus 12.2%; adjusted prevalence  ratio: 0.79, 0.71-0.88) and elevated blood lead levels (children ≤16 years old,  5.2% versus 12.3%; adjusted prevalence ratio: 0.42, 0.28-0.63). Limitations  include potential disease misclassification, missing clinical information, and  cross-sectional nature. CONCLUSIONS: Within-country variations in health status  are often not examined in refugee populations, yet they are critical to  understand granular health trends. Results suggests that the health profiles of  Cuban Americans in Texas differed by entry route.

Little is known, however, about how the youth themselves  think about and understand these types of violence in their communities. In this  article, we seek to answer the following questions: How do Somali immigrants  think about violence in their communities, and the stigma related to this  violence? and What are the implications of these perceptions/beliefs for violence  prevention? Data are drawn from two qualitative studies conducted as part of an  ongoing community-based participatory research (CBPR) collaboration between  academic partners and Somali communities in three cities in North America. Study  1 consists of nine focus groups (n = 36, male only), and Study 2 consists of  in-depth interviews (n = 40, male and female). All participants are Somali young  adults living in North America. Overall, radicalization to violence is seen as a  remote and irrelevant issue in the Somali community. Participants distance  themselves from the idea of radicalization to violence and from those who  participate in radical acts or held such beliefs. In contrast, gang involvement  is characterized as a major problem for Somali communities, and a product of the  marginalization associated with being a refugee in Canada or the United States.

Children  growing up in families where parents have suffered torture and war trauma may  represent a particularly vulnerable group. This study investigates whether  children of torture survivors living in Denmark achieved different test scores  throughout primary and secondary school compared to children of non-traumatized  parents. METHODS: Using data from a national school test programme, tests from  Grades 2-8 were compared for children whose parents had been treated for torture  and war trauma as to their peers. Referral to specialized rehabilitation clinics  was used to identify the traumatized parent group. The mean score difference was  estimated using multilevel linear regression, and outcomes were measured within  groups of parental region of origin to allow for region-specific effects. The  odds of missing a test were also estimated with multilevel logistic regression.  RESULTS: The study included 854 467 children [median age (interquartile range)  =12 (3.3)] of which 7809 were children of the trauma-exposed parents.

Working  refugee children endure socioeconomic deprivation and harsh working conditions.  This study explores the relationship between working conditions and the reporting  of injuries among male and female Syrian refugee children in Lebanon and the  related gender differences. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A cross-sectional survey of  Syrian refugee children working in the Bekaa Valley of Lebanon was conducted in  2017. Face-to-face interviews with children (8 to 18 years) collected  sociodemographic information and testimonies of their work experiences. Logistic  regression tested the association between reporting of injuries and risk factors  including school enrolment, field of work, means of transportation to work, age  started working, number of working hours, multiple jobs, work pressure and  hazards, and abuse. Analyses were stratified by gender. Of the 4090 surveyed  working children, the majority reported working in agriculture (75.8%). Around a  third (31.4%) reported being injured at work with a higher proportion in males.  The most common reported injuries were cuts and wounds (44.9%), with males  showing a higher proportion for all types of injuries compared to females. Nearly  one fifth of reported injuries (19.8%) required medical attention in a hospital,  with males reporting higher proportions than females for most types of injuries.  The study findings revealed the association of multiple risk factors with an  increased odds of reporting an injury, which included working in more than one  job (AOR, 1.71; CI, 1.20-2.43; p = 0.003), working under pressure (AOR, 1.64; CI,  1.36-1.97; p<0.001), the use of sharp or heavy objects (AOR, 1.88; CI, 1.58-2.24;  p<0.001), and experiencing physical abuse at work (AOR, 2.46; CI, 1.97-3.08;  p<0.001). The odds of reporting an injury increased with every additional hour of  work per day (AOR 1.08; CI, 1.02-1.14; p = 0.006). Most of these findings  persisted in the male and female stratified models, with few exceptions. Males  who went to work in a pickup truck had significantly lower odds of being injured  than those who walked (AOR, 0.65; CI, 0.51-0.83; p = 0.001); this finding did not  reach significance for females. Having longer work hours per day was  significantly linked to higher odds of injury for females (AOR, 1.07; CI,  1.02-1.12; p = 0.008); but not for males. The main limitations of this study were  its cross-sectional design and the use of self-reported variables. CONCLUSIONS:  This study is the first to obtain direct testimony on work-related injuries and  working conditions, exploring gender differences, among Syrian refugee children  in Lebanon. Results demonstrated the association between the occurrence of injury  and multiple risk factors highlighting their strenuous working conditions, with  some differences detected between males and females. Many injuries can be  prevented through direct safety interventions and proper implementation of child  labor policies.

This study aims  to assess the prevalence of self-reported sexual risk-taking behaviors among  migrant youth population in Sweden, fulfilling the research gap in that field.  METHODS: A pre-tested, web-based self-administered cross-sectional survey was  used to collect data among 1563 migrant youth (15-25 years old) in Sweden. The  survey was conducted in high schools and Swedish language schools for foreigners  between December 2018 and November 2019. Pearson chi-square and t-tests were used  to compare whether sociodemographic characteristics and migration status varied  between those engaging in sexual risk behaviors or not. Multivariate logistic  regression was used to determine the adjusted odds ratio of the key outcome  variable and independent variables. RESULTS: There is a profound heterogeneity in  migrant youth characteristics related to engagement in different sexual  risk-taking behaviors. Those engaging in condomless sex were older, coming from  the Americas and Europe, living longer in Sweden and came to live with their  family. Belonging to the Islamic religion was a protective factor. Sex under the  influence of drugs was related to those from Europe, and Middle East and North  Africa (MENA) and coming to Sweden to work/study, where age was a protective  factor. Living longer in Sweden, coming for work/study or to live with family had  higher odds to engage in sex in exchange for gifts/money.

Moreover, few studies have  examined whether stress biomarkers track biological sensitivity to brief  interventions targeting the improvement of psychosocial wellbeing. Our study is  the first to prospectively examine, in war-affected adolescents, the associations  between hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) and self-reports of stress,  insecurity, posttraumatic reactions, and lifetime trauma. We conducted a  randomized controlled trial to test the impact of an 8-week intervention based on  profound stress attunement. We collected data for a gender-balanced sample of 733  Syrian refugee (n = 411) and Jordanian non-refugee (n = 322) adolescents (12-18  years), at three time-points. We used growth mixture models to classify cortisol  trajectories, and growth models to evaluate intervention impact on stress  physiology. We observed three trajectories of HCC: hypersecretion, medium  secretion, and hyposecretion (9.6%, 87.5% and 2.9% of the cohort, respectively).  For every one percent increase in levels of insecurity, adolescents were 0.02  times more likely to have a trajectory of hypersecretion (95% CI: 1.00, 1.03,  p = 0.01). For each additional symptom of posttraumatic stress reported, they  were 0.07 times less likely to show hyposecretion (95% CI: 0.89, 0.98, p = 0.01).  Indeed, stronger posttraumatic stress reactions were associated with a pattern of  within-individual cortisol dysregulation and medium secretion. Overall, HCC  decreased by a third in response to the intervention (95% CI: -0.19, -0.03,  p = 0.01). While the intervention decreased HCC for youth with hypersecretion and  medium secretion, it increased HCC for youth with hyposecretion (95% CI: 0.22,  1.16, p = 0.004), relative to controls. This suggests a beneficial regularization  of cortisol levels, corroborating self-reports of improved psychosocial  wellbeing. We did not find evidence to suggest that gender, resilience, or  posttraumatic stress disorder influenced the strength or direction of responses  to the intervention. This robust impact evaluation exemplifies the utility of  biomarkers for tracking physiological changes in response to interventions over  time.

Detrimental gender norms influence  male perpetrated GBV against women, and social and structural contexts of forced  migration and camp resettlement contribute to problematic gender norm  development. The review sought to elucidate the dynamics that link gender  socialization among male youth in sub-Saharan Africa with violent sexual  behaviors. Two concepts were explored: (1) male gender socialization in  sub-Saharan Africa related to GBV perpetration patterns and (2) the effect of  forced migration on male socialization and GBV. We reviewed articles using a  standard systematic review methodology, searching academic databases for  peer-reviewed articles, and contacting experts for gray literature. Our initial  search identified 210 articles. We manually reviewed these, and 19 met the review  inclusion criteria. We identified 20 variables from the first concept and 18  variables from the second. GBV perpetration by male youth is positively  associated with social pressures as well as cultural and religious beliefs. Amid  forced migration, personal, societal, and cultural preexisting gender  inequalities are often amplified to encourage GBV perpetration. The literature  revealed aspects of culture, language, role modeling, religion, and the context  of violence as important factors that shape young men's perspectives regarding  the opposite sex and gender relations as well as sexual desires and dominance.  Overall, though, literature focusing on male socialization and GBV prevention is  limited. We made recommendations for future studies among refugee male youth in  order to better understand these relationships.",Dec-19,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,638-652,,5,20,,Trauma Violence Abuse,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 29333997,,,,Humans; Adult; Female; Male; Child; Adolescent; Young Adult; sub-Saharan Africa; youth; Refugees/*psychology; refugees; Africa South of the Sahara; gender-based violence (GBV); Gender-Based Violence/*psychology; male gender socialization; Socialization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Children  ages 5- to 7-years-old (n = 150; 47% female) and their parents (mean age = 35;  91% mothers) from 6 racial/ethnic and immigrant/refugee groups (n = 25 from each;  African American, Native American, Hispanic, Hmong, Somali, White) participated  in this cross-sectional mixed-methods study. RESULTS: Overall, the majority of HP  2020 objectives were not being met across this low-income, racially/ethnically  diverse, and immigrant/refugee sample of children and adults. In particular,  African American children and parents consistently fell below the majority of the  HP 2020 targets, with only 5 of the 24 HP 2020 objectives being met.  Additionally, immigrant children and parents met less than 2/3 of the HP 2020  objectives. DISCUSSION: Concerted public health efforts are needed to address the  disparities in reaching the HP 2020 objectives and informing the development of  the future HP 2030 objectives among low-income, racially/ethnically diverse, and  immigrant children and parents.

Such  information is crucial for efforts to strengthen MNS services in primary health  care settings for refugees in LMICs. METHODS: Data on 744,036 MNS visits were  collected from 175 refugee camps across 24 countries between 2009 and 2018. The  HIS documented primary health care visits for seven MNS categories:  epilepsy/seizures, alcohol/substance use disorders, mental  retardation/intellectual disability, psychotic disorders, severe emotional  disorders, medically unexplained somatic complaints, and other psychological  complaints. Combined data were stratified by 2-year period, country, sex, and age  group. These data were then integrated with camp population data to generate MNS  service utilization rates, calculated as MNS visits per 1000 persons per month.  RESULTS: MNS service utilization rates remained broadly consistent throughout the  10-year period, with rates across all camps hovering around 2-3 visits per 1000  persons per month. The largest proportion of MNS visits were attributable to  epilepsy/seizures (44.4%) and psychotic disorders (21.8%). There were wide  variations in MNS service utilization rates and few consistent patterns over time  at the country level. Across the 10 years, females had higher MNS service  utilization rates than males, and rates were lower among children under five  compared to those five and older. CONCLUSIONS: Despite increased efforts to  integrate MNS services into refugee primary health care settings over the past 10  years, there does not appear to be an increase in overall service utilization  rates for MNS disorders within these settings. Healthcare service utilization  rates are particularly low for common mental disorders such as depression,  anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and substance use. This may be related  to different health-seeking behaviors for these disorders and because  psychological services are often offered outside of formal health settings and  consequently do not report to the HIS. Sustained and equitable investment to  improve identification and holistic management of MNS disorders in refugee  settings should remain a priority.",2022-05-16,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,183,,1,20,,BMC Med,,,,,,,,eng,© 2022.

This research aimed to investigate psychiatric symptom status of a  sample of refugee women-at-risk recently resettled in Australia, as well as  factors contributing to symptoms of trauma, anxiety, depression, and  somatization. The level of psychiatric symptomatology is compared to reference  groups of women from Sudan and Burma, who entered Australia under the  Humanitarian Entry Programme, and who did not meet criteria as women-at-risk.  METHODS: This is a cross-sectional survey of 104 refugee women-at-risk across  several ethnic groups including a demographic questionnaire, the Harvard Trauma  Questionnaire, Post-migration Living Difficulties Checklist, and Hopkins Symptom  Checklist to assess individual factors, traumatic experiences, post-migration  problems, and symptoms of trauma, anxiety, depression, and somatization. A series  of multiple hierarchical regression analyses examined factors predicting  psychiatric symptoms. RESULTS: Substantial proportions of participants reported  psychiatric distress in symptomatic ranges, including for traumatization (41%),  post-traumatic stress disorder (20%), anxiety (29%), and depression (41%), as  well as significant symptoms of somatization (41%). These findings are  significantly higher than those derived from reference groups of women from Sudan  or Burma, resettled in the same area and utilizing a similar methodology. Higher  numbers of trauma events and post-migration living difficulties predicted higher  trauma, depression, and somatic (but not anxiety) symptoms.

Measurement of child protection system strength  in humanitarian contexts is nascent, and existing methodologies do not capture  the multiple components of the Framework. OBJECTIVE: To develop, pilot and refine  a measure of child protection system strength in humanitarian contexts.  PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: The Child Protection Index [CPI] was implemented in two  humanitarian contexts - Kiziba Camp, Rwanda and Kiryandongo and Adjumani refugee  camps, Uganda, at two time points [Time 1 = T1; Time 2 = T2]. Data collection in  Kiziba camp was conducted in December 2013 and October/November 2015, and in  Kiryandongo and Adjumani in December 2014/February 2015 and June-August 2016.  Participants were staff members of international non-governmental organizations  (T1: n = 17, T2: n = 29), local non-governmental organizations (T1: n = 3, T2:  n = 2), Government bodies (T1: n = 3, T2: n = 3) and United Nations agencies (T1:  n = 14, T2: n = 9) who were purposively selected to respond to the items included  in the CPI. Selection was made on the basis of identifying individuals with the  most knowledge and expertise to address the questions in the CPI. METHODS: We  conducted a qualitative study, conducting key informant interviews based on an  interview guide developed to address the items in the CPI, and tailored to the  expertise of each key informant. The CPI included scoring, to translate key  informants' responses to numerical scores of child protection system strength.  RESULTS: The pilot test conducted in Kiziba Camp indicated moderate child  protection system strength, with a score of 61/100. At T2, results indicated a  change in CPI score of +18.5 to 79.5. At T1, Kiryandongo refugee settlement  received a total of 46/100 on the CPI, and at T2, the score improved by 13.5  points. At T1, Adjumani refugee settlement scored a total of 60/100, and at T2,  received a total score change of +4.5.

What are African refugee women's family planning behaviors (use vs.  non-use of methods, type of methods used)? and What socio-demographic factors and  family planning attitudes are related to family panning behaviors (use or non-use  of methods)? Almost 49% of participants reported ever using a method of family  planning and 35% reported current use. Reasons for non-use included desire for  more children (28.8%), infrequent intercourse (22.0%), and fear of side effects  (16.9%). Nearly two thirds expressed a desire for a future pregnancy (63.4%), but  the majority reported wanting to become pregnant in two or more years (25.7%) or  ""when God wants"" (24.8%). No significant relationship was found between family  planning method use and future pregnancy intention, desired timing of future  pregnancy, perceived fecundity, marital status, religious affiliation, number of  years in the US. Having had any formal schooling decreased the likelihood of  using a family planning method. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE AND RESEARCH: Low  family planning method use rates among African refugee women are not completely  explained by desires for future pregnancy, perceived fecundity, marital status,  or other sociodemographic factors. Concern for future fertility and fear of side  effects were identified as potentially modifiable reasons appropriate for  community based culturally congruent educational interventions on family planning  use.",Jul-20,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,478-486,,4,37,,Public Health Nurs,,,,,,,,eng,"© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 32249486,,,,Humans; Adult; Female; United States; Cross-Sectional Studies; Middle Aged; Pregnancy; Young Adult; Africa/ethnology; Surveys and Questionnaires; refugees; Refugees/*psychology/statistics & numerical data; contraception; *Independent Living; African refugee women; family planning; Family Planning Services/*trends; Intention; reproductive health,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study examines  the type and level of care received among migrant children and descendants of  migrants, particularly investigating disparities in treatment receipt given a  specific diagnosis. METHODS: We used register data of the total population aged  6-17 years in Stockholm, followed from 2006 to 2015, comprising 444 196  individuals, categorised as refugees, non-refugee migrants, descendants of  migrants and Swedish-born.

To more objectively measure this, we conducted a population-wide  investigation of changes in diagnosed point prevalences of anxiety/depression  among children and young adults between 1997 and 2017 in Ontario, Canada.  METHODS: All Ontarians (population approximately 14 million) age 5-25 in each  index year were included and grouped as follows: 5-10, 11-15, 16-20, 21-25. As  the Canadian medical system is public and universal, all diagnoses can be tracked  via billing submissions. The outcome of interest was non-psychotic  anxiety/depression diagnosed by any physician in any setting. Using regression  analyses, cross-sectional administrative (billing) data for 1997, 2002, 2007,  2012 and 2017 for diagnoses of anxiety/depression were linked to indicators of  sex, household income, rurality, and immigrant/refugee status. OUTCOMES: Point  prevalence of anxiety/depression diagnoses increased with age (girls 2·1 to  16·9%, boys 2·9 to 10·6%), particularly from age 11 to 20. Rates, overall,  remained stable until 2012 then rose among 11-15 and 16-20 year-olds. This  pattern varied by sex. An earlier inverse association with rural residency  disappeared by 2017, while immigrant status aligned increasingly with absence of  diagnosed anxiety/depression. Lowest household income quintile was associated  with higher prevalence of diagnoses. LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional data preclude  hypothesising about causes of observed shifts. CONCLUSION: We found no overall  upsurge in youth anxiety/depression, although small increments between 2012 and  2017, and variability with sociodemographic characteristics suggest a possible  looming trend and the merit of studying concomitant and potential explanatory  shifts in social circumstances.",2021-03-01,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,141-146,,,282,,J Affect Disord,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2021.

This approach aims to overcome barriers to  mental health care and to reduce symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)  and depression. METHODS: An uncontrolled study was conducted, evaluating the main  request for help, treatment integrity and feasibility, and the course of symptoms  of PTSD (Children's Revised Impact of Event Scale-13) and depression (Patient  Health Questionnaire modified for Adolescents). RESULTS: In total, 41 minors were  included in the study. Most participants were male (n = 27), predominately from  Eritrea (75.6%) with a mean age of 16.5 (SD = 1.5). Minors mostly reported  psychological problems, such as problems sleeping, and psychosocial problems,  including worries about family reunification. Deviations from the approach were  made to meet the current needs of the minors. Factors limiting the feasibility of  the approach were often related to continuous stressors, such as news concerning  asylum status.

Monitoring TB case notification and treatment outcomes are essential to improve the effectiveness of  TB programs. This study aimed to investigate trends in TB case notification and  treatment outcomes and explore factors associated with unsuccessful treatment  outcome in refugee camps in Ethiopia. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort  study, demographic and clinical data of all TB cases registered in 25 refugee  camps in Ethiopia from January 2014 to December 2017 were extracted. Multivariate  logistic regression was fitted to estimate odds ratios and corresponding 95%  confidence intervals for the measure of association linked with factors  significantly associated with unsuccessful treatment outcomes. RESULTS: A total  of 1553 TB cases, mean age 27.7 years, were registered from 2014 to 2017.

The purpose of this study was to conduct an evaluation of  HT in a real-world, scale-up phase using the RE-AIM framework. METHODS: Using a  cross-sectional, non-comparative design, a community-based program evaluation was  conducted in 29 organizations implementing HT as part of their core service  programs. Data were collected using questionnaires with program participants and  facilitators, and interviews with directors of participating organizations.  Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and qualitative data  were content analyzed. RESULTS: With regards to Reach, over 3400 caregivers,  children and youth attended community programming that offered HT. Among those  attending on the scheduled day for the evaluation, 663 completed the  questionnaires. The majority of caregiver respondents (n = 431) were female (92%)  and attended with children 0-6 years. Respondents also included children  4-6 years (n = 142) and 7-12 years (n = 65), and youth 13-18 years (n = 25).  Effectiveness was demonstrated in reported improvements in physical activity,  healthy eating, and strengthened social connections. HT was also widely supported  by participants and facilitators. Adoption was influenced by the desire to enrich  core service programs for families, HT's fit within existing programs,  organizational commitment, and funding support. Implementation experiences  indicated that fidelity to the HT program was generally maintained, with some  setting specific adaptations. Maintenance of HT was influenced by financial and  non-financial resources within community organizations. Most organizations also  introduced new initiatives to extend support for healthy eating and physical  activity. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate improvements in healthy eating and  physical activity, and social connections among program participants, as well as  efforts by community organizations to create environments to support healthy  weights.

However, little is known about the availability of online resources about  immunisation (for children and adults) directed at refugee and migrant  populations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the health literacy demand  (understandability, actionability & readability) and cultural appropriateness of  immunisation resources in Australia for these communities. METHODS: Our study  involved two search approaches. Firstly, Google trends was used to identify the  most common search terms used in Australia. Search terms used included  'immunisation', 'vaccine' and 'refugee immunisation' amongst others. These search  terms were entered into: Google, Bing, Duck Duck Go and Yahoo and the first 5  pages of results for each search were examined. Searches were conducted from  November 2018 to June 2019. Secondly, requests were sent out directly to key  stakeholders in local health districts and state/territory health departments.  Understandability and actionability were assessed using the Patient Education  Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT). The Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) and  the Flesch readability ease tools were used to assess readability. Cultural  appropriateness was assessed using additional criteria developed by the Centre  for Culture, Ethnicity and Health (CEH), Victoria, Australia. RESULTS: 27/33  resources were included in the analysis. The overall mean understandability score  was 70% (range: 50-100%). The overall mean actionability score of the resources  was 47% (range: 0-83%). In terms of readability, the mean score was a 10.5, which  was indicative of an eleventh grade reading level. The average Flesch-Kincaid  readability score was 47.7. The average score for cultural appropriateness was  79% (range: 29-100%). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that there are currently  not many refugee-specific resources on immunisation. Future work needs to better  improve the health literacy demand of online immunisation information. Engaging  with members from migrant communities is also recommended so that appropriately  tailored resources are co-developed.",2020-09-22,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,6410-6417,,41,38,,Vaccine,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

On the African continent, South Sudan has experienced high levels of population  displacement. Population based baseline trachoma surveys were conducted among  refugee camps in two Sudanese localities hosting South Sudanese refugee  populations to determine whether the SAFE strategy was warranted.  METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Cross-sectional, multi-stage, cluster-random  surveys were conducted within refugee camps in each of two Sudanese localities,  Al Salam and Al Jabalain. For survey sampling, multiple camps within each  locality were combined to form the sampling frame for that locality. Household  water, sanitation and hygiene indicators were assessed, and trachoma signs were  graded by trained and certified graders. The prevalence of trachomatous  inflammation-follicular (TF) in children aged one to nine years was 15.7% (95%CI:  12.1-20.2) in Al Salam and 10.6% (95%CI: 7.9-14.0) in Al Jabalain. The prevalence  of trachomatous trichiasis (TT) in those 15 years above was 2.9% (95%CI: 1.8-4.8)  in Al Salam and 5.0% (95%CI: 3.8-6.6) in Al Jabalain. The presence of water and  sanitation was high in both survey units. CONCLUSION/ SIGNIFICANCE: Sudan has  made progress in reducing the prevalence of trachoma within the country; however,  the presence of over one million refugees from a neighboring trachoma  hyper-endemic country could impact this progress. These surveys were the first  step in addressing this important issue. The results demonstrate that at least  three years of mass drug administration with azithromycin and tetracycline is  needed in addition to the provision of TT surgical services. Additionally, it  highlights that non-endemic or formerly endemic localities may have to adopt new  strategies to provide services for refugee populations originating from  hyper-endemic regions to ensure elimination of trachoma as a public health  problem for all populations.",Jun-19,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,e0007491,,6,13,,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 31194761  PMCID: PMC6592575,,,,"Humans; Adult; Prevalence; Female; Cross-Sectional Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Aged; Child; Adolescent; Young Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Child, Preschool; Infant; *Refugee Camps; Sudan/epidemiology; Trachoma/*epidemiology",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The study population comprised  2,198 refugees and 12,199 Swedish-born individuals with both Swedish-born  parents, aged 16-25 years in 2011, residing in Sweden and treated in specialised  healthcare for CMD 2009-11. Group-based trajectory modelling was used to identify  different trajectory groups of antidepressant use-based on annual defined daily  dosages (DDDs). Multinomial logistic regression was applied to investigate the  association of sociodemographic and medical characteristics with the identified  trajectories. Nagelkerke pseudo-R(2) values were estimated to evaluate the  strength of these associations. RESULTS: Four trajectory groups of antidepressant  use among young refugees were identified with following proportions and DDD  levels in 2011: 'low constant' (88%, < 100), 'low increasing' (2%, ≈710), 'medium  decreasing' (8%, ≈170) and 'high increasing' (2%, ≈860). Similar trajectories,  however, with different proportions were identified in Swedish-born: 67%, 7%, 21%  and 5%, respectively. The most influential factors discriminating the trajectory  groups among refugees were 'duration of stay in Sweden' (R(2) = 0.013), comorbid  'other mental disorders' (R(2) = 0.009) and 'disability pension' (R(2) = 0.007),  while 'disability pension' (R(2) = 0.017), comorbid 'other mental disorders'  (R(2) = 0.008) and 'educational level' (R(2) = 0.008) were the most important  determinants discriminating trajectory groups among Swedish-born youth.

The  starting point is a presentation of the rights to optimal healthcare that can be  derived from the United Nations (UN) Convention on the Rights of Persons with  Disabilities and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. It becomes clear  that for children and adolescents in the status of asylum seekers there are  systematic gaps in the recognition and care of chronic diseases, disabilities and  support needs. An expansion of the health examination after arrival, which has so  far focused on the detection of communicable diseases, is important and necessary  in order to identify individual needs and improve the data situation for this  group. A strengthening of the school entry screening by the public health  service, especially for older children entering school as lateral entrants, could  also significantly improve the nationwide coverage.

The current study examined the associations between SLEs and child  behavioral and emotional outcomes, in addition to family-level measures of  well-being. Method: Children 5-7 years old and their families (n = 150) from 6  racial and ethnic groups (n = 25 each for African American, Hispanic, Hmong,  Native American, Somali, White families) participated in this mixed-methods  study. Participants were recruited through primary care clinics. Results: Results  showed that all racially and ethnically diverse immigrant and refugee families  were experiencing SLEs. The majority of diverse children were experiencing  emotional and behavioral problems (i.e., hyperactivity, emotional) in the face of  SLEs (i.e., combined SLE score, health-related events), with Somali children  being at highest risk. Additionally, the majority of diverse families did not  experience lower family functioning in response the SLEs, except regarding  certain SLEs (i.e., health-related, legal). However, specific families (i.e.,  Somali) experienced lower family functioning in the face of multiple SLEs.  Discussion: Health care practitioners should consider screening and providing  extra resources for reducing stress in children, given all children in the study  had some emotional and behavioral problems in the face of SLEs. Additionally, it  would be important for practitioners to know which families are at greatest risk  for experiencing SLEs (i.e., African American, Native American, Somali families)  to ensure they are provided with the resources necessary to mitigate the impact  of SLEs.

METHODS: Records of 332 infants and children with  complicated severe acute malnutrition were selected by systematic random  sampling. Weight gain was calculated for all participants. Patients who achieved  weight gain of >5 g/kg/day were regarded as achieving adequate weight gain.  Sociodemographic characteristics, season of admission, patients' anthropometry at  admission, source of admission, clinical conditions at admission, types of  medications used, length of stay at the centers, and the centers of the treatment  were considered as covariates. The adjusted odds ratio and its 95% confidence  interval were used to identify factors associated with adequate average weight  gain in the multivariable logistic regression.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study has three components. Component 1 is a  non-randomised controlled trial to compare the FDCC model of care with usual  care. This trial will allocate eligible women to intervention and control groups  based on their proximity to the Hub sites. Outcome measures include: the  proportion of children attending child and family health (CFH) nurse services and  completing their CFH checks to 12 months of age; improved surveillance of growth  and development in children up to 12 months, post partum; improved breastfeeding  rates; reduced emergency department presentations; and improved maternal  well-being. These will be measured using linked medical record data and surveys.  Component 2 will involve a mixed-method implementation evaluation to clarify how  and why FDCC was implemented within the sites to inform future roll-out.  Component 3 is a within-trial economic evaluation from a healthcare perspective  to assess the cost-effectiveness of the Hubs relative to usual care and the  implementation costs if Hubs were scaled and replicated. ETHICS AND  DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was granted by the South Eastern Sydney Local  Health District Human Research Ethics Committee in July 2021 (Project ID:  020/ETH03295). Results will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed  journals and presented at relevant conferences.

Studies about the prevalence and  incidence of epilepsy and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) in this  population are, though, sparse. This Review highlights the importance of  exploring and managing both conditions in these vulnerable people to promote  global health. We performed an exhaustive review of 10 databases, as well as a  manual search of relevant websites related to global health and refugee-related  organizations. We analyzed data related to the prevalence and incidence of  epilepsy and PNES; health visits; costs of medical care and challenges faced by  healthcare workers in relation to FDP with these conditions. Fifty six papers met  our inclusion criteria. Of these, 53 reported directly or indirectly on the  prevalence of epilepsy and its costs in FDP. Two articles reported on the  prevalence of PNES in forcibly displaced people. The reported prevalence of  epilepsy in FDP varied from 0.2% to 39.13%, being highest in people with  pre-existing neurological or psychiatric comorbidities. Only one study reported  on the incidence of epilepsy in internally displaced children. Data from the  United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East  (UNRWA) have identified a tendency to higher incidence of epilepsy in children  following wars. While within displaced women without a history of sexual violence  the rate of PNES was 16.7%, in FDP women with such a history the rate of PNES was  43.7% (p=0.02). The healthcare costs for epilepsy can be high, with recurrent  health visits related to seizures being the most common cause of health  encounters in refugee camps. Increasing awareness and further studies of  multicultural aspects to improve shared understanding of seizure phenomenon in  vulnerable displaced populations would seem crucial.",Nov-21,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,128-148,,,92,,Seizure,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2021 British Epilepsy Association.

Several countries have  repatriated some of these women and children, though most have thus far refused  to do so. Many countries are asking whether it is possible to successfully  rehabilitate and reintegrate this group and how the evidence base could inform  their approach. OBJECTIVE: The overall objective of this paper is to inform the  rehabilitation and reintegration of child returnees from the Islamic State by  rapidly reviewing the evidence on children exposed to trauma and adversity.  METHODS: A rapid review was conducted to identify pertinent evidence regarding  outcomes, risk and protective factors, and interventions and to build a framework  that could guide policies and practices. Prior work in the areas of refugee  children, war-impacted children, child criminal gang members, child victims of  maltreatment, and child victims of sex trafficking was reviewed. Evidence was  collected and analyzed from 31 prior reviews and studies. FINDINGS: The  Rehabilitation and Reintegration Intervention Framework (RRIF) incorporates five  levels (individual, family, educational, community, and societal) and identifies  five primary goals: 1) promoting individual mental health and well-being; 2)  promoting family support; 3) promoting educational success; 4) promoting  community support; and 5) improving structural conditions and protecting public  safety. Implementing this framework requires public-private partnership with  extensive civil society involvement. CONCLUSIONS: Rehabilitation and  reintegration programs should be based on the evidence of prior work with  children exposed to trauma and adversity. RRIF defines a multi-level approach  that encompasses promoting individual mental health and well-being, family  support, educational success, community support, structural conditions, and  public safety. Further multi-disciplinary research is needed to develop evidence  in several identified areas concerning child health and developmental problems,  family custody, faith and religiosity, and violent extremism assessment and  prevention.",2020-06-19,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,64,,1,86,,Ann Glob Health,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright: © 2020 The Author(s).,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 32587814  PMCID: PMC7304453,,,,Humans; Child; Mental Health; *Social Support; Refugee Camps; Syria; *Psychotherapy; *Education; *Public Policy; Adverse Childhood Experiences/*psychology; Evidence-Based Practice; Psychological Trauma/psychology/*rehabilitation; Public-Private Sector Partnerships; Refugees/education/*psychology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding the factors that  shape the trajectories of children's well-being and adjustment in such contexts  is important for informing interventions. METHODS: We collected data at three  time points from a sample of Syrian refugee and Jordanian children (n=650)  residing in Zarqa, Jordan who met eligibility criteria for humanitarian  programming. We assessed primary outcomes of protection concerns, caregiver  stress, mental health, and developmental assets at three time points: baseline  (T1), three months later (T2), and fifteen months after baseline (T3). RESULTS:  Over the fifteen-month study period (T1-T3) child protection concerns and mental  health symptoms improved, caregiver stress remained constant, and developmental  assets deteriorated. School attendance was independently associated with  improvements in protection concerns (β = -1.05, P=0.01), caregiver stress (β =  -0.66, P =0.02), and developmental assets (β = 3.84, P =0.02). Concern over lost  livelihoods significantly predicted higher protection concerns (β = 4.08, P  <0.001) and caregiver stress (β = 2.32, P <0.001). Attending child-focused  programming did not significantly impact primary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This  study documents the capacity for adjustment and adaptation of children in the  context of protracted displacement. The significant influences of attending  school and concern over lost livelihoods on observed trajectories indicate the  importance of addressing structural factors, such as education and employment, in  supporting processes of resilience in these populations.

However, few studies have been carried out about the knowledge and attitudes  about childhood diarrhea among parents in refugee camps and host communities.  OBJECTIVE: This study aims at assessing the caregivers' knowledge and attitudes  regarding acute diarrhea in under-five children among refugee and host  communities in Gambella Region, Ethiopia. METHODOLOGY: This cross-sectional  study, employing multistage sampling, was carried out from September to December  2016. Data was collected by a questionnaire-based interview, and 1667 caregivers  were included in this study. A composite knowledge score was calculated, and a  five-point Likert type of attitude scale was developed to assess the attitudes of  the caregivers towards childhood diarrhea. Appropriate descriptive statistics and  logistic regression models were used. Odds ratios (ORs) are presented with their  95% confidence intervals (CIs), and all analyses were performed at the 5%  significance level (p < 0.05). RESULT: The study indicates that 633 (28.0%) of  the caregivers had poor knowledge, while 393 (23.6%) of them had unfavorable  attitudes towards childhood diarrhea. Knowledge of the caregivers was  significantly associated with formal education (AOR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.03-1.5) and  health information obtained from a health care institution (AOR, 1.8; 95% CI,  1.28-2.3). Caregivers' knowledge is a single predictor of their attitude  (p < 0.001), and Pearson's correlation coefficient revealed that there was a  significant positive correlation (r = 0.2, p < 0.001) between knowledge and  attitude scores.

INTRODUCTION: A key strategy to facilitate effective communication  between limited-English-proficient migrant and refugee families and healthcare  providers is the use of professional interpreters. Despite awareness of the  importance of professional interpreters, interpreters are underutilized. This  results in suboptimal care, including poor access to health care, increased risk  of serious medical events, increased admission to hospital and inadequate health  literacy. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Limited-English-proficient migrant, refugee or  asylum-seeker families with a hospitalized child aged 0 to 18 years, who had used  a professional interpreter, were considered for this review. Comparators included  standard care or no interpreter, and reported results of comparisons of the  duration, frequency or mode of interpreter delivery. Outcomes were length of stay  in hospital, unplanned readmission rates to hospital, non-attendance at hospital  clinic appointments and ambulatory care, child and/or parent satisfaction with  care in hospital, adherence to treatment, medication errors, and other adverse  events relating to patient safety. The review considered all studies conducted  using a quantitative approach. METHODS: A three-step search strategy was used.  Databases were searched in December 2018 for published and unpublished articles.  Studies published in English were considered for inclusion. The recommended JBI  approach to critical appraisal, study selection, data extraction and data  synthesis was used. RESULTS: Six articles reporting results from three randomized  controlled trials and one observational study were included. Studies were  undertaken in the United States involving Spanish-speaking participants. Three  studies were in emergency departments. There was a total of 1813 families, of  whom 1753 had limited English proficiency. Migrant and refugee families with  limited English proficiency reported greater satisfaction with aspects of care  when a professional interpreter service was used compared with using ad hoc  interpreters. Using professional in-person interpreters resulted in a shorter  total emergency department throughput time compared to using professional  interpreters via telephone. There was no difference in concordance of child's  discharge diagnoses between parents assigned professional interpreters and those  assigned bilingual physicians. Video interpretation provided better understanding  of diagnoses than phone interpretation. CONCLUSION: There is evidence that use of  ad hoc interpreters or no interpreter is inferior to use of professional  interpreters of any mode. Although video and in-person interpreters are more  favorable for some outcomes, mode of delivery may not be as important as the fact  that a professional interpreter is being used. The mode of professional  interpreter delivery should be based on accessibility, availability, language  requirements and patient preference.

There is a  significant gap in the literature on trauma and posttraumatic stress symptoms  (PTSS) in unaccompanied young refugees who are still on the move and live in  precarious circumstances such as refugee camps. This study therefore aimed to  contribute to this gap by investigating pre- and peri-migration (potentially)  traumatic experiences of unaccompanied young refugees; longitudinal trajectories  of trauma, daily stressors and PTSS; and the impact of gender, trauma, and daily  stressors on PTSS over time. METHODS: This longitudinal, mixed-method, and  multi-country study was conducted in various settings (e.g. refugee camps,  reception centers) across nine European countries. A heterogeneous sample of  N = 187 unaccompanied young refugees (78.4% male) from 29 different countries was  assessed via interviews at 3 time-points during a period of 27 months. Data was  analyzed via growth curve modelling. RESULTS: Prevalence rates of (potentially)  traumatic experiences ranged from 29.5 to 91.9%. Peri-migration traumatization  remained stable over time (b = - 0.02; p = 0.371), but the number of reported  daily stressors (b = - 0.24; p = 0.001) and PTSS scores significantly decreased  over time (b = - 0.98; p = 0.004). Females reported higher PTSS compared with  males at baseline (p = 0.002), but gender did not influence the longitudinal  trajectory of PTSS. The pre-migration trauma load and daily stressors at baseline  did not have a significant effect on PTSS at baseline or on the longitudinal  trajectory. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to document not only the high  numbers of traumatic events for unaccompanied young refugees pre- and peri-  migration, but also the continued traumatization during flight, as well as high  rates of daily stressors and PTSS. Humanitarian and political assistance is  urgently needed to curb the often life-threatening conditions unaccompanied young  refugees face during migration.",2022-03-31,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,26,,1,16,,Child Adolesc Psychiatry Ment Health,,,,,,,,eng,© 2022.

The prevalence of PPD in Arab countries is higher than the worldwide  prevalence. Additionally, refugee women are more likely to develop PPD than women  in the general population, but little research of refugee women in Arab countries  is available. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees  in the Near East (UNRWA) have provided primary health care to Palestine refugees  since 1950 and began the Mental Health and Psychosocial (MHPSS) programme in  Jordan in 2017 to enhance the psychosocial and social wellbeing of Palestine  refugees. We assessed the prevalence of PPD and examined associated factors among  Palestine refugee women living in Amman, Jordan. METHODS: This cross-sectional  descriptive study was done between April 21 and May 21, 2018. Eligible  participants were Palestine refugee mothers who had given birth 3-16 weeks  previously and were attending any of five UNRWA health centres in Amman that were  launching the MHPSS programme. Data were gathered in face-to-face structured  interviews that included the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) to  assess PPD, the Maternal Social Support Scale to assess levels of perceived  social support, and a structured questionnaire about sociodemographic, obstetric  or paediatric, psychological, and social factors. Participants with scores  greater than 12 in the EPDS were classified as having depressive symptoms.  Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with depressive  symptoms. The study protocol was approved by the Department of Health, UNRWA  Headquarters, Amman, Jordan, and Nagasaki University. Each participant provided  written informed consent. FINDINGS: 251 women participated in the study, with a  mean age of 27·2 years (range 18-42, SD 5·43). 123 (49%) women were classified as  having PPD. Logistic regression showed that factors associated with PPD were  perceived low levels of social support (adjusted odds ratio 3·76, 95% CI  1·92-10·93) and experiencing stressful life events (one event 3·92, 1·51-9·91;  two events 5·77, 2·33-14·27; and three or more events 14·8, 5·23-41·89).  INTERPRETATION: The prevalence of PPD among Palestine refugee women in Amman was  higher than that reported in a previous study of the general childbearing  population (women aged 18-45 years) in Irbid in Jordan (22%, Mohammad et al.  Midwifery 2011; 27: e238-45) but similar to findings in the West Bank (47%,  Quandil et al. BMC Pregnancy Childbirth 2016; 16: 375) and in Syrian refugee  women in Jordan (49·6%, Mohammad et al. Res Nurs Health 2011; 41: 519-245). Our  findings highlight the need to address this disorder in Palestine refugee  mothers. Periodical PPD screening, raising awareness about PPD, providing  information to husbands and families, and building a support system for mothers  could alleviate the risk of PPD. Future studies should examine whether factors of  antenatal depression, which were not assessed in this study, correlate with  having PPD to clarify the need for early intervention in mothers.

In this study,  Palestinian children were considered active agents in their lives, both affecting  and being affected by the world around them. Our research aimed to explore the  role of resources, competencies, and attitudes of spatial agency in the lives of  children in the occupied Palestinian territory. Specifically, we investigated how  children use domestic and social spaces to actively maintain positive function  and wellbeing despite an environmental backdrop of military violence. METHODS: A  convenience sample of 29 children aged 7-13 years (mean 9·66, SD 1·63) attending  the primary school in Dheisheh refugee camp, West Bank, was selected. 17% (5 of  29) were boys and 83% (24) were girls. All children were asked to draw and  describe a map of safe and unsafe places in the camp. Ten children were asked to  continue the conversation outdoors using a ""walk-along"" technique, showing  familiar places and narrating their experiences. Data were collected in April,  2018. All of the children's narratives were audiotaped, transcribed, and  translated by a local bilingual researcher. Thematic content analysis was  applied. Children who have been diagnosed with a physical or psychological  disease were excluded from the sample. The study was approved by the ethical  board of the University of Milano-Bicocca. Written informed consent was obtained  from children and their families, who were informed of the scope of the research.  FINDINGS: Five themes emerged: using the mosque and the school to access  spiritual and educational resources for subjective wellbeing; internal spaces as  a safe place for growth and development (including domestic spaces to experience  a sense of protection and security); community spaces to have fun and play an  active part in the social and political life of the camp; enjoying the outdoor  spaces of the camp despite environmental dangers and the violence of the  occupation. Some children perceived risks and lack of safety in their lives.  Children's narratives made plain the ways in which their ability to mobilise  functioning resources (such as playing and socialising) were constrained by  military and community violence, and environmental degradation. Overall, social  and external places as spaces to restore a sense of normality and happiness were  valorised more by boys than by girls, and girls were more active in internal  spaces than in external spaces. INTERPRETATION: Spatial agency is a key factor  that potentiates wellbeing in children. Psychosocial interventions should aim to  promote children's participation in transforming and reshaping spaces and places  for their own protection and to improve the psychological wellbeing of the  community.

Recent  scholarship has begun to examine how refugees perceived as 'vulnerable', such as  women and children, are frequently prioritized over other groups in humanitarian  responses. Such analyses, however, fail to adequately explain why some groups -  such as older persons - are considered vulnerable and yet are largely neglected.  Based on the case of older Syrian refugees in Jordan, this article critically  examines the ways in which humanitarian health actors make sense of the  humanitarian principle of 'impartiality' in the face of limited resources. Based  on 61 interviews and observational data collected in Jordan between 2017 and  2019, my results show that humanitarians routinely classify older refugees as  'vulnerable' and in need of medical assistance. Yet I find that three neoliberal  considerations - including perceptions of the reduced lifespan, disproportionate  disease burden, and limited contributions to the economy of older refugees - make  this demographic low 'value for money'.

Evidence suggests that although the risk  of developing mental disorders in culturally linguistically diverse (CALD)  adolescents may be elevated, professional help-seeking in CALD youth is low. This  study sought to evaluate the face-to-face teen (tMHFA) and Youth Mental Health  First Aid (YMHFA) training with a CALD focus, which aimed at improving mental  health literacy (MHL) and skills in youth and adults assisting adolescents with  mental health problems. METHODS: An uncontrolled pre-, post-, and follow-up  design was used to measure improvement in MHL measures in year 10 students and  adults. RESULTS: A total of 372 year 10 students from 2 high schools were  trained. 308 responded to the pre-training questionnaire, 220 responded to the  post-training questionnaire, and 256 completed the 3-month follow-up  questionnaire. A total of 34 adults were trained, 32 responded to the  pre-questionnaire and 31 responded to the post-training questionnaire and 20  completed the 3-month follow-up questionnaire. Following training, students were  more likely to endorse 'helpful' adults as valid sources of help (p < 0.001) and  these gains were maintained at follow-up (p < 0.01). Significantly higher levels  of concordant (helpful) helping intentions were found after training (p < 0.01),  and this was maintained at follow-up (p < 0.05). Significant lower levels of  discordant (harmful) helping intentions were found after training (p < 0.001),  and this was maintained at follow-up (p < 0.01). A significant improvement in  adults' knowledge of youth mental health problems and Youth Mental Health First  Aid was noted from pre- to post-training (p < 0.01) and was maintained at  follow-up (p < 0.01). Confidence when helping a young person with mental health  problems increased significantly after training (p < 0.001) and this was  maintained at follow-up (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated the  training led to an improvement in a number of measures of MHL and helpful  intentions of both the adolescents and adults evaluated.

This study analysed the autopsy reports  of foreign nationals in Izmir, in terms of demographic data, date of death, place  of death, manner of death, source of death, histopathology and toxicology results  and exact cause of death. A total of 9951 autopsies were performed between 2015  and 2020 in Izmir, of which 538 (5.4%) were on foreign nationals. Of the autopsy  cases in our study, 55.4% were performed on males and 44.6% were performed on  females; 32.5% of the cases died between the ages of 0 and 10 years. Syrian  nationals comprise 29.7% of the total cases. Of the autopsies of Syrian  nationals, 80% died between the ages of 0 and 10. The cause of death was  determined to be drowning in 42.4% of all cases.

The general health needs of the  refugees are being addressed; however, people with intellectual disabilities  (IDs), particularly children, are relatively missed. The aim of this study was to  identify medical, psychological and social needs of children with ID and their  families, among the Syrian refugee population in Turkey, and to define  psychosocial and cultural needs for planning of future services. METHODS: One  hundred forty-two children (67.6% men; mean age 90.5 months) diagnosed with  intellectual disorders were included in the study. Family Needs Survey, with  additional open-ended and close-ended questions, was used to evaluate family  needs. Items from Developmental Disabilities Profile-2 were used to evaluate and  screen cognitive, motor and language development as well as medical concerns and  behavioural problems. Data on sociodemographic characteristics were also  collected. RESULTS: The highest needs were identified in information and  financial needs domains. Other indicated needs were on child care and community  services domains. The least indicated items were on family and social support and  explaining to others domains. An average of 63.5% of the respondents definitely  agreed with the Family Needs Survey items. The overall level of identification of  need items was higher than that in some previous studies, indicating the level of  unmet needs of the studied population. Family income, parents' employment and  parents' education were not significantly associated with unmet family needs.  Special education services were unreachable for most of the families in the  study. CONCLUSIONS: Families reported the highest needs in information and  financial needs domains. The overall level of identification of needs was higher  than that in some previous studies, indicating the level of unmet needs of the  studied population. The majority of the parents reported that they had sufficient  family and social support, which might be a protective factor for parental mental  health. Parents' Turkish fluency was very significantly associated with every  domain of unmet needs. Language barriers and translation problems had significant  negative effects on families, as confirmed by the answers to open-ended  questions. Another important factor identified was access to service  professionals. Special education services, sorely needed for most of the  families, could not always be reached. Although the progress of children who had  received special education was not very encouraging, it was better than those who  did not receive it. The first implication of the study is that increasing Turkish  proficiency or providing high-quality and consistent translation services is  vital for this category of children with ID. The second implication is that  information and financial needs must be met with priority. Information must be  tailored for each child's needs and developmental level. Special education and  physical therapy must be more accessible and at higher quality.",Aug-20,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,644-656,,8,64,,J Intellect Disabil Res,,,,,,,,eng,© 2020 MENCAP and International Association of the Scientific Study of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 32627246,,,,"Humans; Female; Male; Child; Comorbidity; Adolescent; Syria/ethnology; Child, Preschool; Patient Satisfaction; Turkey/ethnology; Infant; children; refugee; Refugees/*statistics & numerical data; Education, Special; Health Services Needs and Demand/economics/*statistics & numerical data; intellectual disability; Intellectual Disability/economics/ethnology/*therapy; needs assessment; Needs Assessment/economics/*statistics & numerical data",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A layered or tiered  provision of services is recommended as it can be effective to meet the needs of  war-affected adolescents who variably show mental health problems (such as  posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)). The current protocol describes the study  design for a multi-layered intervention model. The study will test the  effectiveness of two interventions: a teacher-training intervention In-Service  Teacher Training (INSETT) combined with targeted cognitive-behavioral  treatment-based Teaching Recovery Techniques (TRT) and a classroom-focused  preventive intervention Peer Integration and Enhancement Resources (PIER). We  analyze, first, whether the interventions are effective in decreasing  psychological distress and increasing positive resources, i.e., prosocial  behavior and resilience among refugee and immigrant students. Second, we analyze  which student-, school-, and parent-related factors mediate the possible  beneficial changes. Third, we look at which groups the interventions are most  beneficial to. METHODS: A three-arm cluster RCT with parallel assignment, with a  1:1:1 allocation ratio, is applied in 16 schools that agreed to participate in  the Refugees Well School interventions and effectiveness study. Schools were  randomized to three conditions of two active interventions and a waiting list  control condition. Students, their parents, and teachers in intervention and  control schools participated in the study at baseline before the interventions,  after the interventions, and at 6 to 12 months after the interventions. The  primary effectiveness criterion variables are psychological distress (SDQ)  symptoms, resilience (CYRM-12), and prosocial behavior (SDQ). DISCUSSION: The  current study presents a recommended universal approach of layered interventions  aiming to reduce psychological distress and increase resilience among refugee and  immigrant students. A combination of promotive, preventive, and targeted  interventions may offer a holistic, ecological intervention package for schools  to better address the needs of the whole group.

Trauma reactivation conducted under the influence of the  reconsolidation blocker propranolol (Reconsolidation Therapy) is a simple,  cost-effective treatment option that has some promising initial results in adults  suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Objective: To explore the  usefulness of this novel treatment in children. The primary outcome was the  reduction of PTSD symptoms at the end of treatment, while secondary outcomes  included reduction in anxiety and in depressive symptoms. Method: An open-label  clinical trial was conducted in a refugee camp in Syria, investigating the safety  and efficacy of this therapeutic strategy in 117 children suffering from enduring  PTSD symptoms. Participants received propranolol 90 minutes before briefly  recalling (i.e. reactivating) a single personal traumatic memory, for 5  consecutive days. Self-reported anxiety, depressive, and PTSD symptoms were  assessed at baseline, as well as 4 and 13 weeks after treatment. Results: A  significant, clinically meaningful symptom reduction was observed at all  post-treatment measurement times vs. baseline. More specifically, between  baseline and the 13-week follow-up we observed a 64% PTSD symptoms reduction (d  = 2.71). In a similar vein, we obtained a 39% symptoms reduction for depressive  symptoms (d = 1.01). The general anxiety symptoms improved, but eventually  returned to prior level, probably because of the deteriorating living conditions  in the camp. Conclusions: This therapy appeared as a potentially safe and useful  treatment strategy for children suffering from PTSD symptoms, warranting  replication studies using stronger study designs.

Turkey hosts the largest number of refugees  displaced in the civil war of Syria. In the present study, we aimed to illustrate  healthcare services provided to Syrian refugees in Turkey. METHOD: Data presented  in this retrospective observational registry study was obtained from  multiple sources including official websites and written communications  contributed by Turkish Disaster and Emergency Management Agency(AFAD), Turkish  Ministry of Health and Turkish Red Crescent as well as the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees(UNHCR). The number of refugee camps, total number of  refugees housed in these camps, the demographic characteristics of the refugees  and a breakdown of social and healthcare services provided in the camps including  the number of healthcare professionals serving in the refugee camps were  analyzed. RESULTS: According to data from UNHCR as of January 12, 2017, there are  4,904,021 registered refugees from Syria of which 2,854,968 (58.2%) are residing  in Turkey. Organized health care services specifically for Syrian refugees in  Turkey was first established in April 29, 2011 in Hatay. Preventative health  services are also provided for Syrian refugees. Among refugees living in the  camps 25% and 33% were not vaccinated for polio and measles respectively. The  percentage of unvaccinated refugees living outside the camps were even higher for  these viruses (45% for polio and 41% for measles). This poses a public health  threat for the population where these refugees reside. CONCLUSION: One of the  major concerns for countries hosting refugees from Syria is the introduction of  infectious diseases. Of the major deficiencies in refugee health care has been  preventative services. Within refugee camps, preventative services for pregnant  woman, newborns and young children as well as family planning services are not at  optimal levels. These services are even more restricted for refugees living  outside of established camps. There have also been shortcomings in the care of  the elderly and those with chronic health problems.",2019-03-20,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,42,,1,85,,Ann Glob Health,,,,,,,,eng,"© 2019 The Author(s).

Mental health of Syrian refugee adolescents: how far have we come? Turk J Pediatr 2019; 61:  839-845. Among the consequences of war, its impact on the mental health of  children and adolescents is one of the most significant. A previous study from  our team evaluated the psychiatric symptoms of Syrian refugee adolescents living  in one of Turkey`s Temporary Accommodation Centers (TACs) in 2016. Findings  suggested that mental health had been compromised in these teens. Since then many  measures have been taken to address this problem. The aim of the current study  was to re-assess the mental health status of adolescents living in the same  center. A total of 76 adolescents (35 female, 41 male) aged between 12-18 years  (14.2 ± 0.83 years) received the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) which assessed  their anxiety, depression, negative self-concept, somatization and hostility  levels in addition to a Global Severity Index (GSI). Results > 1.0 indicated  psychopathological symptoms. All BSI sub-scores decreased from 2016 to 2019  showing significant improvement in psychopathological symptoms. The most  significant change was in the GSI score which decreased from 2.15 to 0.8. For the  2019 participants a significant correlation was found between years of stay at  the camp and the depression subscale. Evaluation to assess gender differences  found that adolescent girls reported significantly higher scores than males in  anxiety, depression, somatization and the global severity index. This study has  shown that interventions designed to tackle post-traumatic stress symptomology  may have been effective in improving the mental health status of these teens and  can provide a roadmap for tackling existing issues in vulnerable conditions.  Additionally, females are under higher risk for psychopathology so gender  targeted interventions may specifically be necessary to deal with such issues.",2019,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,839-845,,6,61,,Turk J Pediatr,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: Turkey PMID: 32134576,,,,Humans; Female; Male; Child; Adolescent; Syria/ethnology; Sex Factors; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; *Mental Health; refugee; Refugees/*psychology; adolescent; Turkey; Syrian; Mental Disorders/*diagnosis; post-traumatic stress; psychiatric symptoms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to investigate 1) the risk of  all-cause and cause-specific mortality in young accompanied and unaccompanied  refugees and non-refugee immigrants compared to Swedish born individuals; and 2)  to determine the role of educational level and migrations-related factors in  these associations. METHODS: This register linkage study is based on 682,358  individuals (633,167 Swedish-born, 2,163 unaccompanied and 25,658 accompanied  refugees and 21,370 non-refugee immigrants) 19-25 years old, who resided in  Sweden 31.12.2004. Outcomes were all-cause mortality and mortality due to suicide  and external causes. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were  calculated using Cox regression models with a maximum follow-up to 2016. RESULTS:  After adjusting for covariates, all-cause mortality was significantly lower in  non-refugee immigrants (aHR 0.70, 95% CI 0.59-0.84) and refugees (aHR 0.76, 95%  CI 0.65-0.88) compared to Swedish-born individuals. The same direction of  association was observed for mortality due to suicide and external causes. No  differences between accompanied and unaccompanied refugees were found. Risk  estimates for all migrant groups varied with educational level, duration of  residency, age at arrival and country of birth. Further, the mortality risk of  migrants arriving in Sweden before the age of 6 years did not significantly  differ from the risk of their Swedish-born peers. Low education was a  considerable risk factor.

Public health,,2468-2667,10.1016/S2468-2667(22)00089-5,,"BACKGROUND: WHO's new Immunization Agenda 2030 places a focus on ensuring migrants and other marginalised groups are offered catch-up vaccinations across  the life-course. Yet, it is not known to what extent specific groups, such as  refugees, are immunised according to host country schedules, and the implications  for policy and practice. We aimed to assess the immunisation coverage of UK-bound  refugees undergoing International Organization for Migration (IOM) health  assessments through UK resettlement schemes, and calculate risk factors for  under-immunisation. METHODS: We undertook a retrospective cross-sectional study  of all refugees (children <10 years, adolescents aged 10-19 years, and adults >19  years) in the UK resettlement programme who had at least one migration health  assessment conducted by IOM between Jan 1, 2018 and Oct 31, 2019, across 18  countries. Individuals' recorded vaccine coverage was calculated and compared  with the UK immunisation schedule and the UK Refugee Technical Instructions. We  carried out multivariate logistic regression analyses to assess factors  associated with varying immunisation coverage. FINDINGS: Our study included  12 526 refugees of 36 nationalities (median age 17 years [IQR 7-33]; 6147 [49·1%]  female; 7955 [63·5%] Syrian nationals). 26 118 vaccine doses were administered by  the IOM (most commonly measles, mumps, and rubella [8741 doses]). During the  study, 6870 refugees departed for the UK, of whom 5556 (80·9%) had at least one  recorded dose of measles-containing vaccine and 5798 (84·4%) had at least one  dose of polio vaccine, as per the UK Refugee Technical Instructions, and 1315  (19·1%) had at least one recorded dose of diphtheria-containing vaccine or  tetanus-containing vaccine. 764 (11·1%) of refugees were fully aligned with the  UK schedule for polio, compared with 2338 (34·0%) for measles and 380 (5·5%) for  diphtheria and tetanus. Adults were significantly less likely than children to be  in line with the UK immunisation schedule for polio (odds ratio 0·0013, 95% CI  0·0001-0·0052) and measles (0·29, 0·25-0·32). INTERPRETATION: On arrival to the  UK, refugees' recorded vaccination coverage is suboptimal and varies by age,  nationality, country of health assessment, and by disease, with particularly low  coverage reported for diphtheria and tetanus, and among adult refugees. These  findings have important implications for the delivery of refugee pre-entry health  assessments and catch-up vaccination policy and delivery targeting child,  adolescent, and adults migrants in the UK, and other refugee-receiving countries.  This research highlights the need for improved data sharing and clearer  definition of where responsibilities lie between host countries and health  assessment providers.

It is known that experience of organised violence,  displacement and resettlement increases the risk for psychiatric disorders and  psychosocial impairment. This review integrates recent research into the risk and  protective factors for psychopathology with service and treatment issues.  METHODS: We draw on and critically evaluate key systematic reviews in the  selected areas, innovative robust studies and relevant government reports.  RESULTS: Many refugee children show resilience and function well, even in the  face of substantial adversities. The most robust findings for psychopathology are  that PTSD, and posttraumatic and depressive symptoms are found at higher  prevalence in those who have been exposed to war experiences. Their severity may  decrease over time with resettlement, but PTSD in the most exposed may show  higher continuity. More severe psychiatric disorders including psychosis may also  occur. Service delivery needs to take into account socioeconomic and cultural  influences but, given the high level of unmet need even in high-income countries,  stepped care delivery is required. The evaluation of psychological interventions,  often delivered in group settings, suggests that they can be effective for many  distressed children; however, for the more impaired, a greater range of  disorder-specific therapies will be required.

We highlight multilevel, need-oriented, and trauma-informed  approaches to regaining and sustaining outer and inner security after exposure to  the trauma of war. The impact of war on children is tremendous and pervasive,  with multiple implications, including immediate stress-responses, increased risk  for specific mental disorders, distress from forced separation from parents, and  fear for personal and family's safety. Thus, the experiences that children have  to endure during and as consequence of war are in harsh contrast to their  developmental needs and their right to grow up in a physically and emotionally  safe and predictable environment. Mental health and psychosocial interventions  for war-affected children should be multileveled, specifically targeted towards  the child's needs, trauma-informed, and strength- and resilience-oriented.  Immediate supportive interventions should focus on providing basic physical and  emotional resources and care to children to help them regain both external safety  and inner security. Screening and assessment of the child's mental health burden  and resources are indicated to inform targeted interventions. A growing body of  research demonstrates the efficacy and effectiveness of evidence-based  interventions, from lower-threshold and short-term group-based interventions to  individualized evidence-based psychotherapy. Obviously, supporting children also  entails enabling and supporting parents in the care for their children, as well  as providing post-migration infrastructures and social environments that foster  mental health. Health systems in Europe should undertake a concerted effort to  meet the increased mental health needs of refugee children directly exposed and  traumatized by the recent war in Ukraine as well as to those indirectly affected  by these events.

The estimated prevalence of moderate and severe acute malnutrition  in children is higher than the national estimates (10.4 and 5.6% respectively,  compared to 3.6 and 1.3%). This study aimed at assessing the quality of care  provided to children with acute malnutrition at out-patient level in such a  setting. METHODS: Six facilities with the highest number of children with  malnutrition were selected. The main tool used was the National Nutrition Service  Delivery Assessment Tool, assessing 10 key areas of service delivery and assigned  a score as either poor, fair, good or excellent. Health outcomes, quality of case  management and data quality were assessed from the health management information  system and from the official nutrition registers. RESULTS: All facilities except  two scored either poor or fair under all the 10 assessment areas. Overall, 33/60  (55%) areas scored as poor, 25/60 (41%) as fair, 2/60 (3.3%) as good, and none as  excellent. Main gaps identified included: lack of trained staff; disorganised  patient flow; poor case management; stock out of essential supplies including  ready-to-use therapeutic foods; weak community linkage. A sample coverage of  45.4% (1020/2248) of total children admitted in the district during the 2016  financial year were included. The overall mean cure rate was 52.9% while the  default rate was 38.3%. There was great heterogeneity across health facilities in  health outcomes, quality of case management, and data quality.

METHOD: The study sample was composed of 116  Syrian refugees (female = 62, 53.4% male = 54, 46.6%) ages 9-18 years with a mean  age of 14.5 years (SD 1.18) who had been in Jordan for at least 3 years and were  studying in five public schools (three for females and two for males) located in  Irbid and Mafraq governorates in the northern area of Jordan between the June 14,  2018 and the March 20, 2019. RESULTS: The results indicated that 116 children out  of 180 (64.4%) suffer from high levels of PB (physical M = 1.47, verbal M = 1.41,  and relational M = 1.35). The most prevailing type of bullying was the physical  type, followed by the verbal and the relational types. Moreover, the three types  of PB were positively and significantly correlated with PTSS (physical, r = .20,  p < .05, verbal, r = .26, p < .01, relational, r = .22, p < .05), and (total PB,  r = .43, p < .05). PB accounted for 14% of the variability in PTSS. Finally, the  results did not indicate any significant differences in PB by gender, age, length  of exposure to PB, living conditions, or disability. CONCLUSIONS: This study may  provide a deeper understanding of the need to develop more thorough,  institutionalized as well individualized, interventions to reduce PB against  schoolchildren from a refugee background in schools.

Public health,,2468-2667,10.1016/S2468-2667(19)30077-5,,"BACKGROUND: Children of refugees are often exposed to the consequences of parental post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), potentially leaving them  vulnerable to intergenerational transmission of psychopathology. The present  study aimed to determine whether parental PTSD is associated with childhood  psychiatric morbidity among children of refugees. METHODS: This study is a  two-generation nationwide cohort study using the Danish Immigration Services  database. We followed up children younger than 18 years with at least one refugee  parent until psychiatric contact, end of the study, their 18th birthday,  emigration, or death. We excluded children if their parents were diagnosed only  with psychiatric diagnoses other than PTSD or if they had received a psychiatric  contact before parental PTSD diagnosis. Information on parental PTSD and  offspring psychiatric morbidity was obtained from the Danish Psychiatric Central  Research Register. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to assess  the risk of psychiatric contacts among children of refugees with PTSD compared  with children of refugees with no psychiatric diagnosis. FINDINGS: Between Jan 1,  1995, and Dec 31, 2015, 102 010 refugees obtained residency permission in Denmark  and 62 239 biological children of refugees were born in Denmark before Dec 31,  2015. 51 793 were eligible and included in the study (median follow-up 7·15 years  [IQR 3·37-11·78]); of these, 1307 (2·5%) children had a psychiatric contact. 7486  (14·5%) children of refugees were exposed to parental PTSD. Parental PTSD  significantly increased the risk of psychiatric contact in offspring (hazard  ratio 1·49 [95% CI 1·17-1·89] for paternal PTSD, p=0·0011; 1·55 [1·20-2·01] for  maternal PTSD, p=0·00084) after adjustment for sociodemographic variables.  INTERPRETATION: Children of refugees exposed to parental PTSD are at increased  risk of psychiatric morbidity. Targeted screening and interventions are necessary  to prevent psychiatric morbidity and ensure access to adequate care.

Undiagnosed PTSD can have detrimental effects on resettlement outcomes.  Immigration medical exams provide an opportunity to screen for mental health  conditions in refugee and asylum seeker populations and provide links to timely  mental health care. OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of screening  tools for PTSD in refugee and asylum seeker populations. METHODS: We  systematically searched Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CENTRAL and CINAHL up to 29  September 2022. We included cohort-selection or cross-sectional study designs  that assessed PTSD screening tools in refugee or asylum seeker populations of all  ages. All reference standards were eligible for inclusion, with a clinical  interview considered the gold standard. We selected studies and extracted  diagnostic test accuracy data in duplicate. Risk of bias and applicability  concerns were addressed using QUADAS-2. We meta-analyzed findings using a  bivariate random-effects model. We partnered with a patient representative and a  clinical psychiatrist to inform review development and conduct. RESULTS: Our  review includes 28 studies (4,373 participants) capturing 16 different screening  tools. Nine of the 16 tools were developed specifically for refugee populations.  Most studies assessed PTSD in adult populations, but three included studies  focused on detecting PTSD in children. Nine studies looked at the Harvard Trauma  Questionnaire (HTQ) with diagnostic cut-off points ranging from 1.17 to 2.5.  Meta-analyses revealed a summary point sensitivity of 86.6% (95%CI 0.791; 0.917)  and specificity of 78.9% (95%CI 0.639; 0.888) for these studies. After  evaluation, we found it appropriate to pool other screening tools (Posttraumatic  Stress Disorder Checklist, the Impact of Event Scale, and the Posttraumatic  Diagnostic Scale) with the HTQ. The area under the curve for this model was  79.4%, with a pooled sensitivity of 86.2% (95%CI 0.759; 0.925) and a specificity  of 72.2% (95%CI 0.616; 0.808). CONCLUSIONS: Our review identified several  screening tools that perform well among refugees and asylum seekers, but no  single tool was identified as being superior. The Refugee Health Screener holds  promise as a practical instrument for use in immigration medical examinations  because it supports the identification of PTSD, depression, and anxiety across  diverse populations. Future research should consider tool characteristics beyond  sensitivity and specificity to facilitate implementation in immigration medical  exams.

In order to help parents address these challenges, the  Norwegian government has instituted a policy of mandatory parent training for  families who settle in Norway as refugees. The Incredible Years (IY) and The  International Child Development Programme (ICDP) have been widely adopted  throughout Norway. They have similar aims: to improve parenting through positive  parenting practices and development of attachment behaviors. We will evaluate the  use of these programs and a measurement feedback system (MFS) to give regular  feedback to interventionists about parents' progress during the course of the  parenting intervention. METHODS: The study is a mixed method, randomized  factorial design aimed at evaluating the effect of parenting interventions and  the use of feedback to address parental stress, child behavior, resilience, and  parents' mental health. Factor 1 is based on random assignment to one of the  parenting interventions IY or ICDP. The parenting interventions are delivered  over 15 weeks (IY) or 12 weeks (ICDP) in group-based settings. Factor 2 is based  on random assignment of the parenting groups to the (a) with MFS or (b) without  MFS condition. The MFS is answered weekly via a phone app, MittEcho, and results  are sent to group leaders in the MFS condition. Additionally, the study explores  the experiences of families settling in a new cultural context and participating  with parenting programs via qualitative interviews. Participants will be  recruited from a population of parents with children between the age of 6 and  12 years who settled in Norway as refugees within the previous 9 years. The  target sample size is N = 360; n (IY) = 180, n (ICDP) = 180 families. This study  is a collaboration between first-line, municipal services; their national  governing agencies; family representatives; and a national network of research  organizations. DISCUSSION: This study endeavors to provide information about what  helps families with refugee background integrate successfully into new cultural  contexts with different laws, norms, and expectations. Whether or not these  interventions can help to normalize this experience, reduce stress, and provide  parents with new tools to improve their parenting and the lives of their children  are important questions which we address.

METHODS: We  compared trends of wasting and stunting prevalence over time and the association  between the coexistence of being both stunted and wasted using Pearson's χ(2)  test. We analysed the effect of an approximate 50% reduction in the general food  distribution, with the introduction of a 20 g daily ration of small quantity  lipid-based nutrient supplements given to all children aged 6-23 months, on child  growth. This was done using interrupted time-series analysis to observe  differences in levels and trends in mean height-for-age z-score (HAZ) and  weight-for-height z-score (WHZ) over time and by age group (6-24 months and 24-59  months). RESULTS: Overall the prevalence of stunting and wasting decreased  significantly over time. The odds of being both stunted and wasted was 1.38  higher than having one or the other condition separately (p<0.001, 95% CI=1.29 to  1.47). Trends in mean HAZ and WHZ before and after a ration change in 2014  indicate that growth had either slowed down or worsened. In the period following  the ration change, children 24-59 months saw a significant decrease in mean HAZ  of 0.04 per year (p=0.02, 95% CI=-0.07 to -0.01) and for the younger age group,  there was a significant decrease in mean WHZ of 0.06 per year (p=0.03, 95%  CI=-0.12 to -0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The dual burden of stunting and wasting is a  considerable challenge in refugee camp settings. Changes to the food distribution  had adverse effects on child growth for both age groups.

The median scores  for PIM-3, PELOD-2, and PELOD2-PDR of patients brought from the Syrian border  were higher compared with Turkish citizens and refugees. There was no significant  difference between refugees and Turkish citizens. Of the patients, 27 died, with  the distribution being 15% Turkish citizens, 26% refugees, and 59% brought from  the border. The mortality of patients transported from the border was  statistically significant (P=0.03). CONCLUSION: We consider that the source of  the difference between patients brought from the border and those living in  Turkey may be associated with the continuing war beyond our borders and children  experiencing insufficient care conditions. In conclusion, it is not just weapons  that cause death in war, and children unfortunately suffer because of this  situation.",Nov-20,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,428-431,,8,27,,Arch Pediatr,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2020 French Society of Pediatrics.

Clinical  trials networks in the field of mental health, however, have been rare and  largely absent from the Australian context. Here, we present an overview of the  newly formed Growing Minds Australia Clinical Trials Network, which represents  the first comprehensive clinical trials network in child and youth mental health  in Australia. The 60 principal members of the Growing Minds Australia Clinical  Trials Network represent teams across 19 diverse areas related to specific forms  of psychopathology (e.g. internalising, externalising, neurodevelopmental  disorders, early psychosis, substance use), specific research methods and  processes (e.g. health economics, eHealth, implementation science) and  specialised areas of practice (e.g. school-based systems, parenting  interventions, Indigenous mental health, refugee families). Core functions of the  Growing Minds Australia Clinical Trials Network include collaborative trial  protocol development; peer review, prioritisation and endorsement of proposed  trials; training; development of clinical guidelines; and consumer  representation. The research by the clinical trials network will encompass the  populations typically accessing youth mental health services, while placing a key  emphasis on the early periods of life, and the role of parents and caregivers as  critical partners in the co-design of research and the delivery of intervention  and prevention strategies. The structures and processes built into the network  are designed to coordinate collaboration between diverse stakeholders and ensure  that provisions for translation are integrated into research from the outset. In  this paper, we examine the potential for a dedicated clinical trials network to  initiate fundamental improvement in child and youth mental health systems, and  discuss the unique and complex challenges associated with establishing such an  initiative.",Feb-23,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,164-168,,2,57,,Aust N Z J Psychiatry,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 35253467,,,,Humans; Child; Adolescent; Australia; Mental Health; *Mental Health Services; *Psychotic Disorders; implementation science; *Substance-Related Disorders; Child mental health; clinical trials; early intervention,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

S.",'Hiding their troubles': a qualitative exploration of suicide in Bhutanese refugees in the USA.,"Global mental health (Cambridge, England)",,2054-4251,10.1017/gmh.2018.34,,"BACKGROUND: Suicide is a major global health concern. Bhutanese refugees resettled in the USA are disproportionately affected by suicide, yet little  research has been conducted to identify factors contributing to this  vulnerability. This study aims to investigate the issue of suicide of Bhutanese  refugee communities via an in-depth qualitative, social-ecological approach.  METHODS: Focus groups were conducted with 83 Bhutanese refugees (adults and  children), to explore the perceived causes, and risk and protective factors for  suicide, at individual, family, community, and societal levels. Audio recordings  were translated and transcribed, and inductive thematic analysis conducted.  RESULTS: Themes identified can be situated across all levels of the  social-ecological model. Individual thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are only  fully understood when considering past experiences, and stressors at other levels  of an individual's social ecology. Shifting dynamics and conflict within the  family are pervasive and challenging. Within the community, there is a high  prevalence of suicide, yet major barriers to communicating with others about  distress and suicidality. At the societal level, difficulties relating to  acculturation, citizenship, employment and finances, language, and literacy are  influential. Two themes cut across several levels of the ecosystem: loss; and  isolation, exclusion, and loneliness. CONCLUSIONS: This study extends on existing  research and highlights the necessity for future intervention models of suicide  to move beyond an individual focus, and consider factors at all levels of  refugees' social-ecology. Simply focusing treatment at the individual level is  not sufficient. Researchers and practitioners should strive for community-driven,  culturally relevant, socio-ecological approaches for prevention and treatment.",2019,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,e1,,,6,,Glob Ment Health (Camb),,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 30854217  PMCID: PMC6401374,,,,mental health; qualitative research; Etiology; refugee populations; suicide,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With elevated  rates of psychological distress and few available resources, task-shifting  psychosocial programmes are necessary to provide adequate care. One such  programme developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) is Group Problem  Management Plus (GroupPM+). Objective: This study aimed to test the safety and  acceptability of GroupPM+ in a refugee camp and to identify areas for adaptation  in preparation for a definitive RCT. Method: A feasibility randomized controlled  trial (RCT) was conducted in Azraq refugee camp in Jordan. Inclusion criteria  were: (1) Syrian adults aged ≥18 years, (2) parent of a child aged 10-16 years,  (3) experiencing psychological distress as defined by a score of ≥16 on the  Kessler Distress Scale, and (4) ≥17 on the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule  2.0. Following baseline assessments, participants were randomized to receive  GroupPM+ or enhanced treatment-as-usual. Post-assessments were conducted one week  following the last GroupPM+ session. Primary outcomes were feasibility and  acceptance of GroupPM+; symptoms of anxiety, depression, PTSD, prodromal  psychosis, grief, and child's self-reported psychological distress were also  assessed. Results: Of the 207 persons screened, 64 (31%) screened positive for  psychological distress. Of the 35 randomized into the GroupPM+ intervention, 24  (69%) completed the intervention. No adverse events were reported throughout the  trial. Children whose parents received GroupPM+ had greater reductions in  internalizing and externalizing symptoms at posttreatment. 55 (86%) participants  completed the post-assessment follow-up. These results demonstrate both the  feasibility of conducting the trial in a camp and acceptance of the GroupPM+  intervention by Syrian refugees. Conclusions: Following the feasibility trial,  both the implementation procedures and intervention were safe and culturally  acceptable. The results support the readiness for a definitive RCT to determine  the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the intervention in camp settings.",2021,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1932295,,1,12,,Eur J Psychotraumatol,,,,,,,,eng,"© 2021 The Author(s).

EmpaTeach is a 10-week, 14-session, classroom management and  cognitive-behavioural therapy-based intervention for groups of teachers for  delivery by lay personnel in resource-constrained settings. METHODS: We will  conduct a two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) with parallel  assignment and an approximately 1:1 allocation ratio. All primary and secondary  schools in Nyarugusu will be invited to participate. Whole schools will be  stratified according to whether they are Congolese or Burundian, and primary or  secondary schools, then randomised to active intervention or wait-list control  conditions via a public meeting with headteachers. We will collect survey data  from n = 500 teachers and at least n = 1500 students before the intervention,  soon after, and at least 6 months after the end of the intervention. The primary  outcome measure will be students' self-reports of experience of physical violence  from school staff in the past week, measured using a modified version of the  International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect Screening  Tool-Child Institutional at the first follow-up after the intervention. Secondary  outcomes include emotional violence, depressive symptoms and educational test  scores. Analysis will be intention to treat, using repeat cross-sectional data  from individuals. DISCUSSION: If successful, the EmpaTeach intervention would  represent one of a handful of proven interventions to reduce violence from  teachers to students in any setting.

Previous reports based on data from  Demographic and Health Surveys suggested systematic differences in anthropometric  data quality between the younger and older groups of preschool children. METHODS:  We analyzed 712 anthropometric population-representative field surveys from  humanitarian and refugee settings conducted during 2011-2018. We examined and  compared the quality of five anthropometric indicators in children aged 6-23  months and children aged 24-59 months: weight for height, weight for age, height  for age, body mass index for age and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) for age.  Using the z-score distribution of each indicator, we calculated the following  parameters: standard deviation (SD), percentage of outliers, and measures of  distribution normality. We also examined and compared the quality of height,  weight, MUAC and age measurements using missing data and rounding criteria.  RESULTS: Both SD and percentage of flags were significantly smaller on average in  older than in younger age group for all five anthropometric indicators.  Differences in SD between age groups did not change meaningfully depending on  overall survey quality or on the quality of age ascertainment. Over 50% of  surveys overall did not deviate significantly from normality. The percentage of  non-normal surveys was higher in older than in the younger age groups. Digit  preference score for weight, height and MUAC was slightly higher in younger age  group, and for age slightly higher in the older age group. Children with reported  exact date of birth (DOB) had much lower digit preference for age than those  without exact DOB. SD, percentage flags and digit preference scores were  positively correlated between the two age groups at the survey level, such as  those surveys showing higher anthropometry data quality in younger age group also  tended to show higher quality in older age group. CONCLUSIONS: There should be an  emphasis on increased rigor of training survey measurers in taking anthropometric  measurements in the youngest children. Standardization test, a mandatory  component of the pre-survey measurer training and evaluation, of 10 children  should include at least 4-5 children below 2 years of age.",2020-11-13,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,60,,1,6,,BMC Nutr,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 33292633  PMCID: PMC7664017,,,,Anthropometry; Survey; Humanitarian; Age group; Data quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Generic mental health services in the United Kingdom (UK) may be  ill-equipped to manage the unique experiences of these young people. Culturally  adapted interventions (CAI) could provide a culturally sensitive approach to  mental health support for refugee children experiencing difficult symptoms. A  systematic review was conducted to determine the different types of cultural  adaptation in the included studies, and to determine the efficacy of CAIs in  comparison to generic treatment. METHODS: Systematic searches of eleven databases  were completed in December 2020. Any psychosocial interventions conducted in the  United Kingdom aimed at providing mental health support for refugee young people  and families were included. This was to ensure the potential inclusion of all  studies regardless of their adherence to the traditional framework of assessment  and intervention in high-income countries, for example randomised control trials.  RESULTS: Eleven studies of varying methodology, participant group, intervention  type and outcome measures were included in this review. Studies used a variety of  cultural adaptations including surface-level and deep-level adaptations. Studies  showed some support for the use of CAIs with young people with R/AS, with varying  degrees of symptom reduction. It was not possible to compare the effectiveness of  CAIs against 'treatment-as-usual', nor to determine the effectiveness of  different CAI components. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst there is evidence for the use of  CAIs with R/AS young people, the heterogeneity between studies limits the  generalisability of these results. The available research is not sufficient to  provide conclusive evidence of the use of CAIs over 'treatment-as-usual'.  Research and clinical implications are highlighted.

It is widely recognized that  humanitarian migrants experience poorer sexual and reproductive health than the  broader population. In turn, a body of research has emerged exploring the sexual  and reproductive health of the local Afghan community. However, this has  predominantly focused on youth or perinatal experiences, and less attention has  been given to the broader relational and social dimensions of sexuality.  Accordingly, this research aimed to explore the perspectives and experiences of  married Afghan women and men as they navigate and negotiate sex, sexuality, and  intimate relationships following settlement in Melbourne, Australia. A total of  57 Afghan women and men participated in six focus group discussions and 20  semi-structured interviews. Male participants described the ways that having  increased access to sex and sexually explicit materials in Australia is creating  opportunities for them to establish more fulfilling sex lives. Many women also  described a growing awareness of sexuality, although often expressed difficulty  prioritizing and claiming more pleasurable sexual encounters for themselves.  However, concerns about sexual freedom are also creating new challenges for the  Afghan community living in Australia in relation to sex and relationships. For  example, men expressed fears about women exercising sexual liberties outside of  the home, and this appeared to place women's everyday behavior under increased  scrutiny. Women also voiced concerns about how easily men can access sex outside  of marriage within Australia, and described how this amplified their sense of  obligation to be sexually compliant and meet their husband's desires. This study  provides new insights into the ways that Afghan community members are moving  between societies, and how their understandings of sexual participation,  pleasure, desire, health, consent, and capacity for self-determination are being  challenged, reshaped, and reconstructed throughout this process.",Jan-23,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,177-189,,1,52,,Arch Sex Behav,,,,,,,,eng,© 2022.

METHODS: This is an associational  study using cross-sectional data. We measured heights and weights of 523 children  aged between 6 and 23 months in households receiving either a food ration  consisting of rice, pulses, vegetable oil (362 children) or an e-voucher (161  children) that could be used to purchase 19 different foods. Data were also  collected on the characteristics of their mothers and the households in which  they lived, including household demographics, consumption and expenditure, coping  strategies, livelihoods and income profiles, and access to assistance.  Associations between measures of anthropometric status (height-for-age z scores,  stunting, weight-for-height z scores, wasting, weight-for-age z scores and  mid-upper arm circumference) and household receipt of the e-voucher were  estimated using ordinary least squares regressions. Control variables included  child, maternal, household and locality characteristics. The study received  ethical approval from the Institutional Review Board of the International Food  Policy Research Institute, Washington DC. RESULTS: Household receipt of an  e-voucher was associated with improved linear growth in children. This  association is robust to the inclusion of maternal, household and location  characteristics. The magnitude of the association is 0.38 SD (CI: 0.01, 0.74),  and statistically significant at the five percent level. We cannot reject the  null hypothesis that these associations differ by child sex. Receipt of an  e-voucher is not associated with stunting when a full set of control variables  are included. There is no association between receipt of e-vouchers and  weight-for-length, weight-for-age or mid-upper arm circumference. We cannot  reject the null hypothesis that these associations differ by child sex.  CONCLUSIONS: In a humanitarian assistance setting, Rohingya refugee camps in  Bangladesh, household receipt of an electronic food voucher instead of a food  ration is associated with improvements in the linear growth of children between 6  and 23 months but not in measures of acute undernutrition or other anthropometric  outcomes.

However, there is a scarcity of scientifically rigorous and reliable  data about the health of children held in detention facilities. The aim of the  study was to compare a community-based population of recently arrived refugee  children flown into Australia, not detained, resettled in a non-urban area, with  a population of children who arrived by boat seeking asylum, detained since  arrival. The parent-version of the strength and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ)  of children aged 4-15 years was compared in children living in the community with  those held in detention. We compared 86 children who had a parent-completed SDQ  performed, 38 (44%) in the community group and 48 (56%) in the detention group.  The community sample had been living in Australia for 325 days, with no time in  detention. The detention sample had been living in detention for a mean of  221 days. The mean age was similar for the community and detention sample at  8.4 years (P = 0.18). In the total sample, children in the detention group had  significantly higher SDQ total difficulties scores than children in the community  group (P < 0.0001). There was no difference between age groups (P = 0.82). The  children in the detention group had, on average, an SDQ total difficulties score  that was 12 points higher than children in the community group. Four of the five  SDQ subscale scores indicated greater disturbance amongst children in detention  (< 0.0001) compared to children living in the community. The detention group had  significantly higher scores (P < 0.001) for all except Pro-social scores as  compared to Australian norms for the 4-6 and 7-15 years age group. This study  presents a rare opportunity to compare the wellbeing of displaced children who  were detained following arrival in Australia with those settled in the Australian  community since arrival. The community children's scores approximated data from  the general Australian childhood population. Children held in detention had  significantly more social, emotional and behavioural difficulties than children  living in the community, and at levels resembling a clinical cohort.

METHODS: Families at the Syrian American  Medical Society Clinic were offered vision screening for children aged 1 to 18  years. Participants were offered visual acuity measurement and photoscreening  with two devices approved for use in the United States. If visual acuity in  either eye was worse than 20/40 or either photoscreening device indicated  possible pathology, a complete eye examination was performed with cycloplegic  refraction and dilated examination. RESULTS: Ninety-one participants completed  the screening protocol. The average age of participants who completed the study  was 7.8 years (range: 1 to 16 years). Twenty-eight participants (30.8%) failed at  least one screening component. In this population, the following pathology was  identified: astigmatism (12.1%), esotropia (9.9%), amblyopia (9.9%), hyperopia  (7.7%), exotropia (3.3%), and myopia (1.1%). The Plusoptix vision screener  (Plusoptix) had a sensitivity of 100% for the identification of amblyopia and 85%  specificity. The GoCheck Kids application (Gobiquity) had a sensitivity of 66.67%  for the identification of amblyopia and 94% specificity. The positive predictive  value for the Plusoptix vision screener and the GoCheck Kids application for the  detection of amblyopia risk factors was 77% for both. CONCLUSIONS: The high rate  of ophthalmic pathology identified in this study reinforces the urgent need for  proper vision screening and intervention in this population.

This review aimed to explore perceptions and  experiences of SRH services and the factors that shape their use among migrant  youth. It focuses on qualitative studies that examine SRH service use among young  migrants living in high-income countries. Seven peer-review databases and  web-based grey literature were searched using pre-determined search criteria. The  review includes 16 articles that met the inclusion criteria. The qualitative  evidence synthesis (QES) method was used to synthesise findings. Thematic  analysis resulted in five main themes and 11 sub-themes. Findings suggest that  despite diversity of countries of origin and host countries, there were  considerable similarities in their perceptions of and experiences with SRH  services. Some young migrants reported experiences of discrimination by service  providers. Cost of care was a deterrent to SRH service use in countries without  universal healthcare coverage. Lack of information about SRH services, concerns  about confidentiality, community stigma around sexually transmitted infections  and premarital sex were key barriers to SRH service use. Health systems should  integrate flexible service delivery options to address access barriers of SRH  service use in young migrants.

This study evaluated  cases of mostly immigrant children followed up with diagnoses of NR in our  pediatric endocrinology clinic. METHODS: Details of 20 cases diagnosed with NR  between 2017 and 2020 were retrieved from file records. RESULTS: Twenty (11 male)  cases were included in the study. Three (15%) were Turkish nationals and the  others (85%) were immigrants. Hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia were detected in  17 and 13, respectively. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) values were normal in two  cases, while ALP and parathyroid hormone (PTH) values were elevated in all other  cases, and PTH levels were very high (473.64 ± 197.05 pg/mL). 25-hydroxyvitamin D  levels were below 20 ng/mL in all cases. Patients with NR received high-dose  long-term vitamin D or stoss therapy. Six patients failed to attend long-term  follow-up, while PTH and ALP levels and clinical findings improved at long-term  follow-up in the other 14 cases. CONCLUSIONS: The elevated PTH levels suggest  only the most severe cases of NR presented to our clinic. Clinically evident NR  is therefore only the tip of the iceberg, and the true burden of subclinical  rickets and osteomalacia remains unidentified.

A significant interaction was found between  moral injury and resilience for internalizing symptoms: high levels of resilience  appeared to buffer the association between moral injury and internalizing  symptoms. Contrary to predictions, stressful life experiences and postmigration  living difficulties did not interact significantly with moral injury to predict  mental health.

More than 50% of refugees  worldwide are children or adolescents. In addition to the challenges of settling  in a new country, many have witnessed or experienced traumatic events. Therefore,  refugee children and adolescents are at risk of developing mental health problems  such as post-traumatic stress disorder, and require appropriate and effective  support within communities. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and  acceptability of community-based interventions (RCTs only) in comparison with  controls (no treatment, waiting list, alternative treatment) for preventing and  treating mental health problems (major depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress  disorder, psychological distress) and improving mental health in refugee children  and adolescents in high-income countries. SEARCH METHODS: Databases searches  included the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (all  available years), CENTRAL/CDSR (2021, Issue 2), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, six other  databases, and two trials registries to 21 February 2021. We checked reference  lists of included study reports.  SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies of any design were  eligible as long as they included child or adolescent refugees and evaluated a  community-based mental health intervention in a high-income country. At a second  stage, we selected randomised controlled trials. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:  For randomised controlled trials, we extracted data relating to the study and  participant characteristics, and outcome data relating to the results of the  trial. For studies using other evaluation methods, we extracted data relating to  the study and participant characteristics. W derived evidence on the efficacy and  availability of interventions from the randomised controlled trials only. Data  were synthesised narratively. MAIN RESULTS: We screened 5005 records and sought  full-text manuscripts of 62 relevant records. Three randomised controlled trials  were included in this review. Key concerns in the risk of bias assessments  included a lack of clarity about the randomisation process, potential for bias is  outcome measurement, and risk of bias in the selection of results. Primary  outcomes There was no evidence of an effect of community-based interventions when  compared with a waiting list for symptoms of post-traumatic stress (mean  difference (MD) -1.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) -6.78 to 3.86: 1 study;  low-certainty evidence), symptoms of depression (MD 0.26, 95% CI -2.15 to 2.67: 1  study; low-certainty evidence), and psychological distress (MD -10.5, 95% CI  -47.94 to 26.94; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence).  There were no data on  adverse events. Secondary outcomes Three trials reported on short-term changes in  child behaviour, using different measures, and found no evidence of an effect of  the intervention versus a waiting list (low to very low certainty). None of the  trials reported on quality of life or well-being, participation and functioning,  or participant satisfaction.

We included both Syrian refugee and Jordanian youth. METHODS: We followed  an experimental design, comparing treatment youth and wait-list controls over two  programme implementation cycles, randomizing to study arm in cycle 2  (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03012451). We measured insecurity, distress, mental  health difficulties, prosocial behaviour and post-traumatic stress symptoms at  three time-points: baseline (n = 817 youth; 55% Syrian, 43% female),  postintervention (n = 463; 54% Syrian, 47% female), and follow-up (n = 212, 58%  Syrian, 43% female). Regression models assessed: prospective intervention  impacts, adjusting for baseline scores, trauma exposure, age, and gender;  differential impacts across levels of trauma exposure and activity-based  modality; and sustained recovery 1 year later. We analysed cycle-specific and  cycle-pooled data for youth exclusively engaged in Advancing Adolescents and for  the intent-to-treat sample. RESULTS: We found medium to small effect sizes for  all psychosocial outcomes, namely Human Insecurity (β = -7.04 (95% CI: -10.90,  -3.17), Cohen's d = -0.4), Human Distress (β = -5.78 (-9.02, -2.54), d = -0.3),  and Perceived Stress (β = -1.92 (-3.05, -0.79), d = -0.3); and two secondary  mental health outcomes (AYMH: β = -3.35 (-4.68, -2.02), d = -0.4; SDQ: β = -1.46  (-2.42, -0.50), d = -0.2). We found no programme impacts for prosocial behaviour  or post-traumatic stress reactions. Beneficial impacts were stronger for youth  with exposure to four trauma events or more. While symptoms alleviated for both  intervention and control groups over time, there were sustained effects of the  intervention on Human Insecurity.

METHODS: The qualitative study consisting of structured focus group discussions  (FGDs) was held in four provinces in Turkey where Syrian refugees live intensely  in September and October 2020. Seven different types of online FGDs were held  with Turkish HCWs working in maternity hospitals, Syrian HCWs working in Refugee  Health Centers (RHCs), Syrian pregnant women, mothers, fathers, and grandmothers.  In total, we carried out 46 FGDs with 335 individuals. Thematic analysis of the  transcripts in a deductive-inductive fashion was carried out with MAXQDA 11.  RESULTS: Most Syrian HCWs did not get any training on breastfeeding counseling.  The short duration of breastfeeding in Syrian refugees was seen to be related to  the cultural characteristics, and migration. Some cultural characteristics can be  summarized as ""believing that breastfeeding harms mother's health"", ""adolescent  marriages"", ""wanting to have as many children as possible"", ""giving anise to  infants and not breastfeeding at night"", ""prelacteal feeding"", ""believing that  milk is not enough"", ""over controlling mother-child interaction by grandmothers,  which limits the interaction"", ""short pregnancy intervals"", and ""not using modern  family planning techniques"". We found out that migration increased the tendency  for adolescent pregnancies, deepened the poverty, and decreased family social  support.

These  changes might affect the quality of life (QOL) of pregnant woman. This study  aimed to examine the levels of quality of life and perceived social support of  Syrian refugees' pregnant women in Al-Zaatari Refugee Camp in Jordan. METHODS: A  cross-sectional survey design was used. A sample of 319 pregnant women was  recruited from two maternal health clinics at Al-Zaatari Refugee Camp. Data were  collected from June to August 2020 using the Arabic version of World Health  Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF), the Multidimensional Perceived Social  Support (MSPSS) questionnaires, and two sheets were used to assess  sociodemographic and obstetric variables. RESULTS: The study reveals that Syrian  refugees' pregnant women had good satisfaction with their overall QOL and health  status and social support. A significant relationship was found between the  socioeconomic index and QOL. Also, age, being in the third trimester, and parity  correlated negatively with QOL. In contrast, those who stayed in Jordan as a  refugee for a longer period reported better QOL. CONCLUSION: Syrian women in  Jordan, in general, have a good QOL and high level of social support.

This study examines the attitudes toward physical abuse and experiences of  intimate partner violence (IPV) of Rohingya refugee women who experienced child  marriage. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in the Rohingya refugee  settlement at Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. Attitudes towards physical abuse have been  assessed by a set of five questions that asked the situation under which 'hitting  or beating' one's wife is justifiable. Multivariable logistic regressions are  used to examine the associations of exposure to child marriage with (i) attitudes  towards the justification of physical abuse by one's husband and (ii) experiences  of IPV in the 12 months prior to the survey. Data are available for 486  participants. Overall, 61.32% of women experienced child marriage (married before  18 years of age) and they were more likely to have strongly justified  beatings/hitting one's wife under certain circumstances (Adjusted Odds Ratio  (AOR) = 2.71; 95%CI: 1.78, 4.11), and to have experienced such IPV by their  husbands in the 12 months prior to the survey (AOR = 1.72; 95%CI: 1.13, 2.61).  These AORs are higher for women married at ages 12-14 than those married at  15-17. Having some formal education among husband and wife is protective of abuse  within a marriage.

We draw on the experiences of Syrian-American  mental health professionals with nine years of experience providing clinical and  programmatic mental healthcare in combat settings, siege, internally displaced  person camps, and refugee camps. RESULTS: Collaboration with nonprofessional  personnel was essential due to the shortage of formally trained mental healthcare  professionals in Syria. The use of psychological and diagnostic terms increased  stigma, whereas asking about the patient's identified problem, ""suffering,"" or  ""challenges"" supported engagement. War-related trauma and horizontal violence  commonly affect Syrian children, adolescents, and adults. Resilience and  engagement were enhanced by sensitivity to patients' dignity, religious  acceptance, and faith. CONCLUSIONS: The Syrian war remains an ongoing public  health and humanitarian crisis in which mental healthcare must adapt rapidly to  specific needs and resources of the patient and community.

This study aimed at determining the prevalence and the outcomes  (including anaemia) of the respective infections and co-infections. Anaemia is a  condition in which the number of red blood cells transporting oxygen to the  various body parts is not sufficient to meet the needs of the body. METHODS: This  was a cross sectional study conducted among 476-refugee camp school children.  Kato-Katz technique was used to screen stool samples for intestinal parasites.  Microscopy was used for malaria testing while the portable Haemoglobin (Hb)  calorimeter was used to measure haemoglobin concentration. RESULTS: The overall  prevalence of the mixed infections was 63.03%. Plasmodium falciparum was most  prevalent of the single infections 262(55.04%) followed by Taenia spp. 14 (2.9%),  Schistosoma mansoni 12(2.5%), Giardia lamblia 7 (2.9%), Trichuris trichiura  2(0.4%), Hookworm 2(0.4%) and Strongyloides stercoralis 1(0.2%). The odds of  developing simple or uncomplicated malaria infection or anaemia was 14 times  higher in individuals with dual co-infection with Plasmodium falciparum + Taenia  sp. compared to single parasitic infection (Odds = 14.13, P = 0.019).  Co-infection with Plasmodium falciparum + Taenia spp, was a strong predictor of  Malaria and anaemia. CONCLUSION: This study shows that Plasmodium falciparum and  Taenia spp. co-infections is a stronger predictor of malaria and anaemia. The  prevalence of malaria and anaemia remains higher than the other regions in Uganda  outside restricted settlements.

The ICRC  Primary Health Care program has focused on refugee and host communities in these  areas. This study objectives were: 1) to determine whether the ICRC program was  reaching the most vulnerable populations; 2) to understand the key perceived  health needs in the catchment areas of the ICRC supported facilities; and 3) to  identify barriers to utilization of health care services. METHODS: Between July  and September 2017 we conducted two cross-sectional studies - one randomized  household survey and one clinic-based - in the catchment areas of three  ICRC-supported facilities, targeting women of reproductive age and caretakers of  children under five. Differences between groups were analysed with t-test or  chi-squared test. RESULTS: In the household survey, similar socio-demographic  profiles were observed between Syrian refugee women and vulnerable Lebanese  hosts. With regard to the study objectives:The most vulnerable populations were  those seen in the ICRC-supported facilities.For both populations, the most common  reasons for seeking care were non-communicable diseases (40.6%) and sexual and  reproductive health issues (28.6%). Yet the people reaching the ICRC supported  facilities were more likely to seek care for communicable diseases affecting  their children (37.8%), rather than for the most common reasons expressed in the  household survey.In the catchment areas, reported gaps included low immunization  coverage and low levels of antenatal care and family planning both for Syrian and  Lebanese. Dental care also emerged as an issue. Out of pocket expenditures was  reported as a critical barrier for utilization of primary health care services  for both populations, while the most important barrier for utilization of  ICRC-supported services was lack of awareness. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the ICRC  reaching the most vulnerable Syrian and Lebanese communities, the  population-based survey revealed that important gaps exist in terms of  utilization of health care services among women of reproductive age and their  children.

Refugees can experience a variety of traumas throughout  the process of migration. Children can be exposed to multiple traumas such as  experienced or witnessed physical or sexual violence, loss and bereavement,  parental separation and the threat of persecution and/or kidnapping. The third  stage of the migration journey can add further stress; children and families may  experience multiple rejections of asylum application effectively living in limbo  with the constant threat of deportation. High rates of mental health disorder are  well documented in young asylum seekers, particularly depression, anxiety and  post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PRS is less frequently described but  nonetheless a severe and life-threatening condition affecting young asylum  seekers. Traumatisation, cultural factors and hostile asylum processes are  specific moderating factors seen in asylum-seeking children. Asylum-seeking  children normally make a full recovery from PRS. This study suggests a link  between prolonged asylum processes and hostile foreign policy in developing and  maintaining illness; similar cases are now being reported in other countries with  hostile foreign policies.

The  aim of the study was to evaluate incidence rates of childhood TB and detailed  diagnostic pathways and treatment. METHODS: Data were collected through the Swiss  Pediatric Surveillance Unit (SPSU) from December 2013 to November 2019. Monthly  -notifications are obtained from the 33 pediatric hospitals in the SPSU, and a  detailed questionnaire was sent out upon notification. Inclusion criteria were  children and adolescents aged up to 15 years with culture- or molecular-confirmed  TB disease or for whom a treatment with ≥3 antimycobacterial drugs had been  initiated. Data were compared with age-matched notification data from the Swiss  Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH). RESULTS: Of the 172 cases notified to  SPSU, a detailed questionnaire was returned for 161 (93%) children, of which 139  met the inclusion criteria. Reasons for exclusion were age >15 years, double  reporting, and not fulfilling the criteria for TB disease. During the same time  period, 172 pediatric TB cases were reported to the FOPH, resulting in an  incidence of 2.1 per 100,000, ranging from 1.4 to 2.8 per year, without a clear  trend over time. In the 64 (46.0%) foreign-born children, incidence rates were  higher and peaked in 2016, with 13.7 per 100,000 (p = 0.018). The median interval  between arrival in Switzerland and TB diagnosis was 5 (IQR 1-21) months, and 80%  were diagnosed within 24 months of arrival. In 58% of the cases, TB disease was  confirmed by culture or molecular assays. Age >10 years, presence of fever, or  weight loss were independent factors associated with confirmed TB. CONCLUSION:  The annual pediatric TB incidence rate only varied among foreign-born children  and was highest in 2016 when refugee influx peaked in Europe. Importantly, most  foreign-born children with TB were diagnosed within 2 years after arrival in  Switzerland. Thus, the early period after arrival in Switzerland is associated  with a higher risk of TB disease in children, and this should be considered for  screening guidance in refugees.",2021,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1050-1059,,11,100,,Respiration,,,,,,,,eng,"© 2021 The Author(s) Published by S.

However,  there is limited evidence regarding effective strategies for engaging Latino  immigrant youth using social media. As part of the Avance Center for the  Advancement of Immigrant/Refugee Health in Washington, DC, USA, we implemented  Adelante, a branded primary prevention program, to address risk factors for  co-occurring substance use, sexual risk, and interpersonal violence among Latino  immigrant adolescents aged 12 to 19 years in a Washington, DC suburb. OBJECTIVE:  The objectives of this study were to (1) characterize Adelante participant  Facebook reach and engagement and (2) identify post content and features that  resulted in greater user engagement. METHODS: We established the Adelante  Facebook fan page in October of 2013, and the Adelante social marketing campaign  used this platform for campaign activities from September 2015 to September 2016.  We used Facebook Insights metrics to examine reach and post engagement of  Adelante Facebook page fans (n=743). Data consisted of Facebook fan page posts  between October 1, 2013 and September 30, 2016 (n=871). We developed a 2-phased  mixed-methods analytical plan and coding scheme, and explored the association  between post content categories and features and a composite measure of post  engagement using 1-way analysis of variance tests. P<.05 determined statistical  significance. RESULTS: Posts on the Adelante Facebook page had a total of 34,318  clicks, 473 comments, 9080 likes or reactions, and 617 shares. Post content  categories that were statistically significantly associated with post engagement  were Adelante program updates (P<.001); youth achievement showcases (P=.001);  news links (P<.001); social marketing campaign posts (P<.001); and prevention  topics, including substance abuse (P<.001), safe sex (P=.02), sexually  transmitted disease prevention (P<.001), and violence or fighting (P=.047). Post  features that were significantly associated with post engagement comprised the  inclusion of photos (P<.001); Spanish (P<.001) or bilingual (P=.001) posts; and  portrayal of youth of both sexes (P<.001) portrayed in groups (P<.001) that were  facilitated by adults (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Social media outreach is a promising  strategy that youth programs can use to complement in-person programming for  augmented engagement. The Latino immigrant youth audience in this study had a  tendency toward more passive social media consumption, having implications for  outreach strategies and engagement measurement in future studies. While study  findings confirmed the utility of social marketing campaigns for increasing user  engagement, findings also highlighted a high level of engagement among youth with  posts that covered casual, day-to-day program activity participation. This  finding identifies an underexplored area that should be considered for health  messaging, and also supports interventions that use peer-to-peer and  user-generated health promotion approaches.",2018-12-19,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,e71,,4,4,,JMIR Public Health Surveill,,,,,,,,eng,"©Elizabeth Louise Andrade, W Douglas Evans, Nicole Barrett, Mark Cameron Edberg, Sean D Cleary.

This study examines  asylum-seeking parents' perceptions of parenting their 2-6-year-old children,  focusing on the spatial context of the reception centre. We conducted 26  semi-structured interviews among parents in three reception centres in Finland.  The results show that parenting was challenged by all three dimensions of place:  location, locale and sense of place. The findings indicate that for parents, the  reception centre is an essential factor interacting with parenting, enabling or  impeding caregiving. These findings are discussed from the viewpoints of  transnationalism, insufficient children's spaces and activities and lost sense of  place. We urge policy-makers to improve the spatial context for parenting in  reception centres by ensuring adequate children's spaces and activities,  including opportunities for early learning, privacy of the family, parents'  social support and possibilities for establishing everyday routines. We suggest  that these improvements would have far-reaching beneficial implications for the  healthy development and future mental health of asylum-seeking children.",Jul-22,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,102823,,,76,,Health Place,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

METHODS: All refugees (children/adolescents and adults) arriving in Aarhus,  Denmark from 1 January 2014 to 1 November 2018 were offered a general health  assessment by a doctor including: medical history, a physical examination and  blood samples. RESULTS: A cohort of 1431 (of 1618 invited, (88.4%) participants  accepted the health assessment. The most commonly found health conditions in  children were vitamin D deficiency (28.3%), elevated serum-IgE (34%) and lack of  immunity against vaccine-preventable diseases (measles 20.1%, polio 3.9%).

The aim of this study was to examine whether individual  resilience (assessed as a personality characteristic) can protect adolescents in  diverse contexts from negative effects of trauma exposure. METHOD: A path model  was used to assess whether individual resilience buffered the negative effects of  exposure to PTEs in a cross-sectional study of adolescent refugees (aged 12-17  years; n = 117) and their Dutch peers (n = 148). Measurements included the  Children's Revised Impact of Event Scale, Strengths and Difficulties  Questionnaire, Satisfaction with Life Scale and the Resilience Scale. RESULTS:  The moderating effects of individual resilience on the relationship between PTEs  and mental health problems and life satisfaction were mixed: In the nonrefugee  group, but not in the refugee group most moderation effects reached significance.  CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that not all groups benefit similarly from  individual-level resilience. Consequently, adolescents, who differ with regard to  the risks to which they are exposed, may need different forms of support. This  study points to the interplay of factors that contributes to demonstration of  individual resilience.

Contacts of all refugees  diagnosed with pulmonary TB (PTB) were registered by the International  Organization for Migration and screened for active & latent TB infection (LTBI)  in 6 NTP centres.The objectives of this study were to assess prevalence of active  TB and LTBI, risk factors for LTBI as well as program performance. METHODS: We  performed a retrospective study among contacts (N = 481) of all PTB cases  diagnosed between March 2011 and May 2014 (N = 76). CT was performed using verbal  screening of TB-related symptoms, tuberculin skin test (TST) and chest X-ray.  RESULTS: LTBI was diagnosed in 24.1% of contacts tested with TST while active TB  was diagnosed in 2.1% of contacts. Main risk factors for positive TST included  smear-positive index case (IC) (OR: 6.33) and previous TB infection in the family  (OR: 4.94).

This was done by  observing a breastfeeding support scenario through wet nursing in Rohingya  refugee camps in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. METHODS: Information on demographics,  IYCF-E knowledge, wet nursing support, type of constraints faced, and possible  ways to overcome such constraints was collected through face-to-face interviews  with 24 conveniently selected wet nurses. Linear regression was used to analyze  the associations. RESULTS: Mean age of wet nurses was 21.6 years; 16.67% had  adequate knowledge about IYCF-E; and 29.17% had prior knowledge about wet  nursing. Mean age of supported infants was 1.29 months, and 58.33% had a familial  relationship with the wet nurses. Duration of breastfeeding support was  significantly associated with the wet nurse's age, age of the wet nurses'  youngest children, familial relationship with infants, knowledge about IYCF-E,  and follow-ups from community nutrition workers (Ps <0.05). The status of facing  problems (58.33%) was negatively correlated with duration of wet nursing,  although this association was not statistically significant. The most extensively  reported problems were as follows: misunderstandings with the infant's family  (85.71%), family workload and time limitations (21.43%), household distance  (42.86%), and family members' poor compliance (21.43%). Counseling from community  nutrition workers (64.29%) and mediation by community leaders (57.14%) played key  roles in mitigating such problems. Self-satisfaction (37.50%), counseling  (62.50%), and religious inspiration (58.33%) were key motivators behind dedicated  breastfeeding support.

In fact, it is one of the most ethnically diverse cities in the United States with  almost 100 languages spoken by children in the public school system. The city's  immigrant and refugee population speaks limited English, and most of these  residents are unfamiliar with where or how to obtain health care services through  the American health care system. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITY: We developed a  peer language navigator (PLN) program. IMPLEMENTATION: The Anchorage Health  Literacy Collaborative developed a community-wide program to address the health  literacy needs of the city's immigrant and refugee population. Select people who  attended Anchorage's adult literacy program (the Alaska Literacy Program) were  chosen to learn about health and wellness topics as well as how to obtain health  information from reliable online sources. These people, initially known as PLNs,  were then trained to share health information resources with their respective  communities. RESULTS: A recent evaluation of the program using ripple effects  mapping showed that the program has demonstrated wide success, providing  understandable health information to hundreds of new English learners throughout  the area and guiding them to reliable health and wellness information they can  use for themselves, their families, and their community. PLNs have become leaders  in their communities and have been renamed peer leader navigators. LESSONS  LEARNED: For similar programs to be successful, PLNs should be trained using  adult learning principles, allowing them to focus on topics and issues of  interest to them. The program should link with community organizations to extend  the reach of the program. Care must be exercised to avoid overextending or  overwhelming PLNs because after they become leaders in their communities, they  will receive many requests to provide guidance and education. Finally, when  possible, PLNs should be compensated so they can more fully devote their efforts  to serving the community. [HLRP: Health Literacy Research and Practice.  2019;3(Suppl.):S15-S24.]. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: The Anchorage Health Literacy  Collaborative in Alaska developed a program in which immigrant and refugees  attending the city's adult education program to learn beginning English are  chosen to serve as peer language navigators (PLNs). The PLNs learn how to obtain  credible and easy-to-understand health information and then share it with their  respective cultural communities. Lessons learned over time are shared.",Jul-19,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,S15-S24,,3 Suppl,3,,Health Lit Res Pract,,,,,,,,eng,"©2019 Johnson, Shepard, Van Den Berg, et al.",,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 31687655  PMCID: PMC6826755,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority are forced displaced refugees and children unaccompanied by a caregiver, and have  limited access to essential public health interventions. Routine vaccination  might be interrupted or be incomplete due to conflict areas with limited public  health services or a long-unplanned journey. Refugees and migrants may bring  infectious disease risks to their country of destination and may be exposed to  new risk factors during transit or at their destination. There are lessons  learned strategies among refugees and asylum seekers in different countries  (vaccination campaign during outbreak, maintain vaccination systems for refugees  and medical screening and/or vaccination on arrival) against vaccine-preventable  diseases - other than meningococcal infections. Since the 1980s, invasive  meningococcal disease (IMD) has been reported as a critical healthcare issue in  places of humanitarian crisis such as Thailand and African's meningitis belt.  Refugees and migrants are at increased risk of IMD compared with the overall  population due to sero-epidemiology in their country of origin, specific  characteristics of the IMD, and a number of contacts during the journey.  Recently, IMD cases due to serogroups X and W have been reported and are an  emerging health threat for persons arriving from Africa to refugee camps in  Italy. There have been sporadic case reports of IMD due to serogroup B in Turkey;  however, there has not yet been increased disease activity in this population and  no outbreaks have been observed. Outbreaks of IMD in refugee camps have been and  could be successfully controlled through the implementation of timely and  high-coverage vaccination campaigns, and individual cases of IMD can be treated  with antibiotics. Research is needed to determine the prevalence of meningococcal  carriage and serogroup distribution among refugees and migrants to inform vaccine  recommendations. There is no official recommendation for meningococcal  vaccination of refugees. Further strategies for prevention and treatment of human  immunodeficiency virus, tuberculosis and antibiotic resistance among refugees are  directly related to potential prevention methods for IMD. Meningococcal vaccines  have been administered only to risk groups in most host countries Thus, further  strategies for the definition of new/emerging risk factors for IMD would be  helpful to guide vaccine implementation for refugees and immigrants.",2020-11-01,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,2781-2786,,11,16,,Hum Vaccin Immunother,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 32347773  PMCID: PMC7746237,,,,"Humans; Child; refugee; *Emigrants and Immigrants; *Refugees; Turkey; Africa/epidemiology; migrants; Neisseria meningitidis; *Meningitis, Meningococcal; *Meningococcal Infections/epidemiology/prevention & control; *Meningococcal Vaccines; IMD; Italy; meningococcal; Thailand",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, the  recent proliferation of school-based social and emotional learning (SEL)  initiatives presents an opportunity to strengthen supports for resettled  adolescents. This participatory research study aims to understand how high school  students resettled from countries in the Middle East and North Africa region are  experiencing the challenges and opportunities of acculturation and the ways in  which they believe schools can better support them in this process. METHODS: We  analyzed primary data collected during focus group discussions as part of the  SALaMA study. During these discussions, we used participatory ranking methodology  to elicit adolescents' suggestions on how high schools can better support  students both academically and psychosocially after resettlement. Fourteen focus  group discussions were held with male (n = 38) and female (n = 31) adolescents  aged 14-20 years, who were selected purposively across six public high schools in  Harrisonburg, Virginia, Austin, Texas, and Detroit, Michigan. Participants  offered suggestions and then ranked them in order of importance using consensus  ranking. RESULTS: Thematic analysis of the PRM results across sites produced a  wealth of suggestions centered around three broad themes, namely: skills related  to navigating social and academic challenges, culturally responsive teaching, and  socially and culturally equitable learning environments.

As a priority population group, families of index  clients have been largely neglected due to a number of different factors. Testing  sexual partners and children of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive  persons (index case finding) is a promising way of identifying HIV-positive  persons unaware of their HIV status. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to  determine the proportion of index case family testing and its associated factors  among adults attending an ART clinic at Kule Refugee Camp, southwestern Ethiopia,  2021. METHODS AND MATERIALS: An institution-based cross-sectional study was  conducted at Kule Refugee Camp, Gambela region. A total of 348 adult ART clinic  attendants were selected by using systematic random sampling technique. Data were  collected by using a pre-tested interviewer-administered semi-structured  questionnaire. The collected data were entered into Epi-Data 3.1 and exported to  SPSS version 23. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were  used to identify factors associated with index case family testing. The strength  of association was assessed by adjusted odds ratio, and statistical significance  was declared at a p-value <0.05 and 95% CI. RESULTS: The proportion of index case  family testing was 49.%. Educational level: primary level (AOR=2.4, 95%  CI=1.24-4.42), secondary level and above (AOR=2.6, 95% CI=1.20-4.70), ART  adherence (AOR=6, 95% CI=2.8-14.1), years on ART (AOR=2, 95% CI=1.10-3.20),  discussion about HIV testing (AOR=3.6, 95% CI=1.30-10.30), disclosure status (AOR  6, 95% CI=2.21-16.94), and being tested through voluntary counseling and testing  (AOR=3.0, 95% CI1.70-5.70) were factors significantly associated with index case  family HIV testing. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: This study revealed that the  proportion of index case family HIV testing in Kule Refugee Camp was 49%.  Educational status, adherence status, disclosure status, years on ART, and  voluntary counseling and testing were determinant factors.

Assessing these risk factors is foundational in  determining potential areas for intervention. We used the social ecological model  to examine risk factors associated with self-reported mental health symptoms  among clinic-attending Syrian refugee women in Jordan. We hypothesize that  individual (older age, unmarried, have more children under 18, difficulty  reading/writing with ease), interpersonal (intimate partner violence [IPV]),  community and societal level risk factors (greater number of postmigration  stressors), will be associated with depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic  stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. METHODS: We surveyed 507 women using a  cross-sectional clinic-based systematic sampling approach between April and  November 2018. We used multivariable regressions to examine associations between  different risk factors in the social ecology on depression, anxiety, and PTSD.  Additional multivariable regressions explored associations between specific  postmigration stressors and mental health conditions. RESULTS: We found rates of  depression among our sample to be 62.92%; anxiety 57.46%; and PTSD 66.21%. Our  hypothesis was partially supported. At the individual level, age was directly  associated with anxiety (aOR 1.04, 95% CI [1.02, 1.06]) and PTSD (aOR 1.03, 95%  CI [1.01, 1.06]), while marriage decreased odds for depression (aOR 0.41, 95% CI  [0.19, 0.92]) and PTSD (aOR 0.36, 95% CI [0.15, 0.87]). IPV was associated with  depression (aOR 2.78, 95% CI [1.72, 4.47]); anxiety (aOR 3.30, 95% CI [2.06,  5.27]); and PTSD (aOR 5.49, 95% CI [3.09, 9.76]). Each additional community and  societal risk factor (postmigration stressor) increased the odds for depression  (aOR 1.32, 95% CI [1.22, 1.42]), anxiety (aOR 1.28, 95% CI [1.19, 1.39]), and  PTSD (aOR 1.46, 95% CI [1.33, 1.60]). CONCLUSION: Understanding social ecological  risk factors associated with mental health conditions of Syrian refugee women is  vital to addressing their mental health needs. IPV and postmigration stressors  are consistently impactful with all mental health conditions. IPV resulted in the  largest odds increase for all mental health conditions.

Most of them found themselves in Poland; thus, an urgent need for ad hoc  humanitarian and systemic aid arose. To cope with the situation, a number of  changes to the Polish law were introduced so as to provide help to the refugees  (mainly women and children) from Ukraine. To systematise the changes, the authors  of the study analysed the legal acts that had been created or amended for the  purposes of providing aid to the refugees staying in Poland. The research study  has shown that, in the first days following the war's outbreak, the measures of  key importance were the grassroot initiatives taken by Polish citizens, but as  days went by, systemic aid became indispensable.

However,  prevalence data are lacking, and little is known about whether particular forms  of RCA are more or less common. The aims of our study were to explore how  frequently people seeking pregnancy counselling reported RCA, the proportions  reporting the different forms of RCA, and whether there were different trends  based on a range of demographic factors. METHODS: Data were collected from 5107  clients seeking counselling support for their pregnancy between January 2018 and  December 2020 from two leading providers of pregnancy counselling and sexual and  reproductive health services in Australia, Marie Stopes Australia and Children by  Choice. Counsellors identified and recorded the presence of RCA and whether the  behaviour was pregnancy promoting and/or pregnancy preventing. Demographic  factors included age, and whether the person identified as being from a migrant  or refugee community or as an Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander person.  RESULTS: RCA was identified in 15.4% of clients, with similar proportions  disclosing RCA towards pregnancy (6%) and towards pregnancy prevention or  abortion (7.5%), and 1.9% experiencing RCA towards pregnancy and abortion  concurrently. There were no differences based on age or whether the person  identified as being from a migrant or refugee background, though people who  identified as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander experienced RCA that was  significantly more likely to be pregnancy promoting. CONCLUSIONS: RCA is commonly  disclosed by people seeking support in a pregnancy counselling context, and  coercion and abuse is equally likely to be towards pregnancy promotion or  pregnancy prevention/abortion. Given the prevalence and negative impacts of RCA,  regardless of age and background, we recommend sensitive and culturally  respectful enquiry around experiences of RCA be embedded in healthcare, health  education, and health research.",2022-07-30,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,170,,1,19,,Reprod Health,,,,,,,,eng,© 2022.

HL  performance was particularly sensitive to language, cognitive, and input  variables indexing cumulative HL exposure. L2 performance, however, was sensitive  to cognitive and environmental variables indexing current and cumulative L2 use.  Finally, despite stronger performance in Arabic than in English, results revealed  interdependence between the two languages, indicating that participants with  stronger syntactic abilities in their HL tended to have stronger syntactic  abilities in their emerging L2.",Jul-22,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,741-773,,4,49,,J Child Lang,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 34034835,,,,Humans; Canada; Language; Cognition; *Multilingualism; Language Development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A small number reach wealthy western countries and seek asylum. Over half are children. Wealthy  reception countries have increasingly adopted restrictive reception practices  including immigration detention. There is an expanding literature on the mental  health impacts of immigration detention for adults, but less about children. This  scoping review identified 22 studies of children detained by 6 countries  (Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Netherlands, the UK and the US) through searches  of Medline, PsychINFO, Emcare, CINAHL and Scopus data bases for the period  January 1992-May 2019. The results are presented thematically. There is  quantitative data about the mental health of children and parents who are  detained and qualitative evidence includes the words and drawings of detained  children. The papers are predominantly small cross-sectional studies using mixed  methodologies with convenience samples. Despite weaknesses in individual studies  the review provides a rich and consistent picture of the experience and impact of  immigration detention on children's wellbeing, parental mental health and  parenting. Displaced children are exposed to peri-migration trauma and loss  compounded by further adversity while held detained. There are high rates of  distress, mental disorder, physical health and developmental problems in children  aged from infancy to adolescence which persist after resettlement. Restrictive  detention is a particularly adverse reception experience and children and parents  should not be detained or separated for immigration purposes. The findings have  implications for policy and practice. Clinicians and researchers have a role in  advocacy for reception polices that support the wellbeing of accompanied and  unaccompanied children who seek asylum.",Oct-21,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1615-1639,,10,30,,Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry,,,,,,,,eng,"© 2020.

This qualitative study explores these issues as  perceived by Syrian refugees who have been living in Shatila, a Palestinian camp  in South Beirut, Lebanon, for at least 2 years. METHODS: Twenty eight in-depth  interviews with men and women were conducted between February and June 2018.  Women were recipients of mental health services, and men were recruited from the  local community. Interviews were conducted in Arabic, translated, transcribed,  coded and analysed using thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Our results show  patterns of harsh living conditions similar to those described earlier in the  course of the Syrian refugee crisis. Lack of infrastructure, overcrowding,  cramped rooms and violence were all reported. Participants also described a lack  of social support, discrimination and harassment within the host community, as  well as limited social support networks within their own Syrian refugee  community. Family dynamics were affected by the increased responsibilities on  men, women and children; with additional economic and employment demands on men,  women assuming the roles of 'mother and father' and children having to work and  contribute to the household. Participants discussed several types of violence,  including parental violence against children and violence in the community.  Violence against women was also reported. Reported mental health issues included  depression, anxiety, sadness, frustration, hopelessness, self-neglect and a loss  of sense of self and self-worth. Some participants expressed a wish to die.  CONCLUSIONS: This study describes experiences of changing gender roles, family  dynamics, violence and mental health after long-term displacement in in Shatila  camp, South Beirut as perceived by Syrian refugees. A lack of safety and security  coupled with economic hardship rendered refugees even more susceptible to  exploitation and harassment.

In  Switzerland, 35 to 50% of children are vitamin D deficient. Due to skin colour,  poor nutrition, living conditions and cultural practices, migrant population is  particularly at risk. Our aim is to attest the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in  children arriving in Switzerland. We retrospectively assessed 528 children's  vitamin D status and parathyroid hormone, phosphate and calcium levels between  2015 and 2018 by electrochemiluminescence and spectrophotometry. Cholecalciferol  was considered insufficient under 50 nmol/L and severely deficient below 25  nmol/L. Seventy-three percent of children showed hypovitaminosis D and 28% had a  severe deficiency. Highest prevalence of deficiency was found in children from  Eastern Mediterranean (80%) and African regions (75%). Severe deficiency was more  prevalent in the South East Asian (39%) and Eastern Mediterranean regions (33%)  and more frequent in females. Deficiency was more frequent and more severe in  winter. Hypovitaminosis D increased with age. Two children presented with all  three biological manifestations associated to severe hypovitaminosis D  (hyperparathyroidism, hypocalcaemia and hypophosphatemia).Conclusion: A majority  of migrant children presented with hypovitaminosis D. They should be supplemented  to prevent complications. A strategy could be to supplement all children at  arrival and during wintertime without regular vitamin D level checks.

Systematic violence, as committed against the Yazidi minority in Northern Iraq by  the terror organization known as the Islamic State (IS), can be seen as a  particularly traumatic burden to the victims, but also to caregivers providing  treatments and assistance to them. The intense exposure to traumatic content may  cause secondary traumatization in respective caregivers. This study aims (1) to  identify the prevalence of secondary traumatization in caregivers working with  traumatized women and children from Northern Iraq; (2) to determine the specific  distressing factors and resources of the caregivers; as well as (3) to analyze  whether caregivers' personal history of trauma or flight, attachment styles,  working arrangements as well as support offers qualify as risk or resilience  factors for secondary traumatization. Materials and Methods: In this  cross-sectional study, N = 84 caregivers (social workers,  psychotherapists/physicians, and interpreters) in the context of a Humanitarian  Admission Program (HAP) for women and children traumatized by the so called IS  were investigated about their work-related burdens and resources. Secondary  traumatization was assessed with the Questionnaire for Secondary Traumatization  (FST). To identify relevant determinants for secondary traumatization multiple  linear regression analyses were performed. Results: Secondary traumatization was  present in 22.9% of the participating caregivers, with 8.6% showing a severe  symptom load. A personal history of traumatic experiences, a personal history of  flight, a higher number of hours per week working in direct contact with refugees  as well as a preoccupied attachment style were detected as risk factors for  secondary traumatization. A secure attachment style could be identified as a  resilience factor for secondary traumatization. Discussion: Caregivers working  with traumatized refugees are at high risk of developing secondary  traumatization. Based on the findings of this study and theoretical  considerations, a framework of classification for different types of  trauma-associated psychological burdens of caregivers working with traumatized  refugees is proposed. Implications for the training and supervision of  professionals in refugee- and trauma-care are discussed.",2018,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,234,,,9,,Front Psychiatry,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: Switzerland PMID: 29922186  PMCID: PMC5996169,,,,trauma; refugees; resilience; attachment style; caregiver; genocide; secondary traumatization; Yazidi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If food and money is scarce, it may be  that the broader family meal environment looks different in families with  continuous access to food (food secure, FS) compared to families with FI. Using  ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and qualitative data, this study explores  meal characteristics and parent feeding practices at nearly 4000 family meals in  a low-income, racially/ethnically diverse and immigrant/refugee sample. For 8  days, participants (i.e., parents of 5-7-year-old children) completed a survey  every time they shared a meal with their child. Additionally, parents completed a  qualitative interview regarding family meals. There were many meal  characteristics statistically correlated with a family being FI, including: who  prepared the meal and how the meal was prepared, the makeup of people at the  meal, the meal location and meal atmosphere, and the food served at the meal.  Qualitative data illuminated many of these findings from EMA meal surveys.  Quantitatively, families with FI and FS reported similar parent feeding practices  during family meals. Qualitatively, families with FI and FS reported differences  in (1) parent feeding practices; (2) food served at family meals; (3) challenges  to having family meals; and 4) adults' role in the family meal.

UASC are the most vulnerable of all refugee populations. Up to 90% of UASC have  been subjected to exploitation, including trafficking or being drafted into  military groups. Having survived the perils of flight, UASC are confronted with  continued challenges, including the uncertainties regarding their residential  rights in host counties. Unsurprisingly, the prevalence of mental health problems  is higher amongst UASC than in any other refugee group. Yet, Mental Health and  Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) appears to neither reach nor engage UASC. This begs  for re-examination of what and how MHPSS is offered. Despite high levels of  adversity, UASC often have considerable resilience, and make remarkable  recoveries. However, literature exploring their resources or their own views of  what helps or hinders recovery is scarce. In this narrative review, we explore  individual and systemic factors promoting recovery in UASC. We consider  theoretical understanding of resilience, emerging data and user perspectives.  From these we deduct four areas of resilience in UASC: Individual factors -  prosocial behaviour, problem-solving skills; Lifetime relationships - positive  early family relationships, connection with family and country of origin,  positive peer and adult relationships in host country; Acculturation -  integration of own and new culture, positive relationships with prosocial  institutions; Care arrangements - supported but less restrictive living  arrangements. We suggest, MHPSS may need to focus on enhancing social networks,  including connectedness with positive relationships in the home-country,  life-history work with a focus on resource-building experiences in addition to  trauma, and promoting integration of old and new cultural values. We also  conclude that despite growing data, there is a gap in both eliciting user  perspectives and understanding adaptive resources, especially those emerging  during early development and within their cultural setting.

Understanding what factors contribute to poor health  outcomes throughout the reproductive life cycle and across the continuum of care  is crucial for improving health programming in acute and protracted refugee  settings. METHODS: We undertook a mixed-methods baseline assessment of factors  related to maternal and neonatal health among refugees living in the Dadaab  refugee complex in eastern Kenya. The qualitative component included 23 focus  group discussions with 207 community members and 22 key informant interviews with  relevant UN and non-governmental organization staff, community leaders, health  managers, and front-line health care providers. We analysed qualitative data for  content and themes using inductive and deductive techniques. RESULTS: Taking a  life course perspective, we found that the strong desire for large families and  the primary social role of the woman as child bearer impacted maternal and  neonatal health in the camps through preferences for early marriage, low demand  for contraception, and avoidance of caesarean sections. Participants described  how a strong fear of death, disability, and reduced fecundity from caesarean  sections results in avoidance of the surgery, late presentation to the health  facility in labour, and difficulty gaining timely informed consent. Mistrust of  health service providers also played a role in this dynamic. In terms of newborn  care practices, while breastfeeding is culturally supported and women  increasingly accept feeding colostrum to the newborn, mixed feeding practices and  application of foreign substances to the umbilicus continue to present risks to  newborn health in this community. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from our study  showcase the role that specific sociocultural beliefs and practices and  perceptions of health care services have on maternal and neonatal health. An  in-depth understanding of how these factors impact the utilization of biomedical  health services provides valuable information for targeted improvements in health  service provision that are tailored to the local context.",2019,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,11,,,13,,Confl Health,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 30976297  PMCID: PMC6440025,,,,Refugee camp; Kenya; Somali; Maternal and newborn health; Reproductive health,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When acute, somatic, and neurologic causes are excluded,  along with substance use, a consideration of psychiatric disease is imminent.  Here, we present a case with amnesia, where diagnostics and treatment were  challenging due to severe psychiatric symptoms and course of the disease. CASE  REPORT After a minor trauma while driving an electric scooter, a 41-year-old man  lost all memories of the past 20 years. The patient was raised in a refugee camp,  where he experienced traumatic events, and later came to Denmark and established  family and work life. He had 1 prior contact with the psychiatric ward. After the  incident, the patient was brought to the emergency room. The patient could not  recognize his wife or children and believed he was 21 years old and living with  his mother in the refugee camp. A full somatic and neurological workup was  performed and no somatic or organic cause could explain the retrograde amnesia.  He developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and psychotic symptoms.  Treatment consisted of a combination of psychoeducation, cognitive remediation,  and medical treatment for psychotic symptoms and PTSD. CONCLUSIONS The diagnosis  ""prolonged delirium"", ""PTSD"", and ""dissociative amnesia"" were considered.

Western Pacific,,2666-6065,10.1016/j.lanwpc.2021.100175,,"Background: Rohingya girls living in the refugee camps in Bangladesh are disproportionately vulnerable to child marriages and teenage pregnancies. This  study examines the factors affecting child marriage and contraceptive use among  Rohingya girls who have experienced child marriages. Methods: We collected and  analysed quantitative and qualitative data from adolescent Rohingya girls (age  10-19 years) who experienced child marriages. The quantitative data (n=96) came  from a cross-sectional survey, and the qualitative data (n=18) from in-depth  interviews conducted in the world's largest refugee camp located in Cox's Bazar,  Bangladesh. We also interviewed service providers (n=9) of reproductive  healthcare services to gain their perspectives regarding contraceptive use among  these young girls. We used descriptive statistics to characterise the girls'  demographic profiles, ages at their first marriages, and contraceptive use.  Thematic analysis was used for the qualitative data to identify key factors  influencing child marriage and contraceptive use among these girls. Findings: On  average, the adolescent female participants had been 15.7 years old when they  were first married. Over 80% had given birth during the two years before the  survey or were pregnant during time of the data collection. The main factors that  influenced child marriage were found to be perceptions regarding the physical and  mental maturity for marriage, social norms, insecurity, family honour,  preferences for younger brides and the relaxed enforcement of the minimum legal  age for marriage. A third (34%) of the girls said they were using contraceptives  on the week when the study was conducted. The desire for children, religious  beliefs, misapprehension about contraception and long waiting periods in  facility-based health services and current service provision were the main  factors influencing contraceptive use. Depo Provera injections and pills were the  dominant methods of contraception. Contraceptive use during the period between  marriage and the first childbirth is rare. Interpretation: Girl child marriage is  common in Rohingya camps. Contraceptive use is rare among newly married girls  before they give birth for the first time. The involvement of female and male  Rohingya volunteers for outreach services can be catalytic in promoting  contraceptive use. Funding: La Trobe Asia, La Trobe University, Melbourne,  Australia.

The aim of this qualitative  study was to examine the nature of violence against adolescents in Kiziba Camp,  Rwanda, using an ecological framework to analyze the factors that influence  protection risks and abuse disclosure across multiple system levels. In order to  understand these issues more comprehensively, a transgenerational inquiry sought  perceptions from both adolescents and their caregivers. In April 2016, as part of  a larger, comprehensive study on adolescent protection, 19 focus group  discussions were conducted with a total of 70 adolescents and 68 caregivers from  the Democratic Republic of Congo. A qualitative content analysis identified three  salient themes. First, structural protection risks exist for adolescents in  Kiziba Camp, with economic insecurity and resource constraints resulting in  specific risks such as overcrowded housing and adolescents traveling for firewood  collection. Second, intergenerational conflict between caregivers and adolescents  was perceived to negatively influence abuse disclosure. Lastly, protection  mechanisms and reporting pathways were underutilized as caregivers and  adolescents expressed concern over the shame, embarrassment, and social rejection  that characterized formal disclosure in Kiziba, often rooted in restrictive and  inequitable gender norms. These findings suggest that efforts at child protection  should be multi-faceted and address structural aspects of risk; household levels  of communication and trust; and societal norms that deter abuse reporting. The  study also underscores the need for further research on risk and protective  factors in camp settings to better tailor interventions aiming to reduce violence  against children.",Mar-18,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,83-91,,,200,,Soc Sci Med,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS: Upon diagnosis of 3 TB cases among camp residents, an ACF  intervention among contacts was implemented. All camp residents were offered  two-step screening, that is tuberculin skin testing (TST) followed by chest X-ray  in case of positive TST (defined as ≥5 mm). RESULTS: 336 of 379 (89%) camp  residents underwent TST testing, of whom 110 (33%) exhibited a positive skin  reaction. The rate of positive TST results was particularly high in the elderly  and significantly higher in adults than in children. Differences by sex or  nationality were not observed. Of the 110 cases with positive TST, only 75  underwent chest X-ray, resulting in the detection of one pulmonary TB case in an  adult woman.

Many  refugees from Afghanistan or Iran speak either Dari or Farsi, which are mutually  intelligible dialects of the Persian language. Previous research on adult  refugees and immigrants have shown that internet-based cognitive behavioural  therapy (ICBT) can be a valuable complement to other forms of treatment. However,  there is a lack of knowledge if ICBT is a feasible and acceptable treatment for  adolescents and young adults with a refugee background. METHOD: Fifteen  Dari/Farsi-speaking adolescents and young adults between 15 and 26 years of age  participated in a feasibility study of a novel individually tailored guided ICBT  intervention targeting symptoms of common mental disorders such as anxiety and  depression. Self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed using  the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25) as the primary outcome measure. Four  of the treatment participants and three additional non-treatment participants  consented to be interviewed regarding the programme's acceptability. The  interviews were analysed using Thematic Analysis. RESULTS: The intervention  suffered from low adherence, with only 3 participants completing the  post-treatment assessment and with participants completing 0.9 modules on  average, which meant that the intended quantitative analysis of the pre to post  change was not possible. The thematic analysis resulted in two overarching  categories, barriers and facilitators, that each contained four themes and  related subthemes. Overall, the intervention was deemed culturally relevant and  easy to understand. The most salient barriers to participation across interviews  concerned interference of symptoms such as concentration difficulties, low  energy, and a lack of human contact and support. CONCLUSION: The current version  of the ICBT program demonstrated low feasibility and acceptability in the target  population, which mainly seemed to be related to the delivery format. Future  studies should investigate if a blended treatment format with regular phone/video  calls with a therapist can increase adherence to the intervention.",Apr-22,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,100533,,,28,,Internet Interv,,,,,,,,eng,© 2022 The Authors.

METHODS: A total of 1597  surveys containing data on under-five death rate, population status (internally  displaced, refugee, or crisis-affected resident), measles containing vaccine  coverage, and global acute malnutrition were extracted from the Complex Emergency  Database (CE-DAT). Under-five mortality rates were dichotomized to those  exceeding critical levels or otherwise. A Bayesian multivariable mixed-effect  logistic regression model was used to assess the association between an  under-five death rate (U5DR) exceeding this threshold and population status  (i.e., internally displaced, refugees or residents), GAM prevalence (proxy for  food security), and MCV coverage. RESULTS: The prevalence of GAM, MCV and U5DR  were higher in internally displaced children (IDC) with values of 14.6%, 69.9%  and 2.07 deaths per 10 000 per day, respectively. Refugee populations had lower  average under-five mortality rate (0.89 deaths per 10 000 per day), GAM of 12.0%  and the highest measles containing vaccine coverage (80.0%). In crisis-affected  residents the prevalence of GAM, MCV and average U5DR are 11.1%, 65.5% and 1.20  deaths per 10 000 per day respectively. In mixed-effect logistic model taking 2  deaths per 10 000 children less than five years old per as emergency threshold  (Model III); MCV (AOR = 0.66, 95% Highest Density Interval (HDI): 0.57, 0.78),  GAM (AOR = 1.79, 95% HDI: 1.52, 2.12) were associated with a reduction of the  odds of U5DR exceeding critical level accounting for country-specific levels of  variability. The odds of U5DR exceeding critical level (2/10000/day) in  crisis-affected resident children and refugees were 0.36 (95% HDI: 0.22, 0.58)  and 0.25(95% HDI: 0.11, 0.55) less than amongst IDP children adjusting for GAM  and MCV. In considering country specific yearly median U5DR (model IV) the odds  of U5DR exceeding twice the median U5DR were associated with MCV (AOR = 0.72, 95%  HDI: 0.64, 0.82), GAM (AOR = 1.53, 95%HDI: 1.34, 1.76). The odds of U5DR  exceeding critical level in crisis-affected resident children was 0.30(95% HDI:  0.20, 0.45) less than IDP children, after adjusting for MCV and GAM. We found no  difference between the odds of U5DR exceeding twice the country level median U5DR  in the refugee population compared to the IDPs. CONCLUSIONS: In this study  vaccination coverage and global acute malnutrition (proxy for food security) were  associated with U5DR exceeding critical level. The emergency threshold for IDPs  and affected residents is significantly different and consistent across the  different outcomes, whereas the result is inconsistent for IDPs and refugees.  Continued improvement in measles vaccination coverage and reduction of  malnutrition in humanitarian emergencies have the potential to minimize the  deterioration of mortality level amongst children in emergency settings.

METHODS: During 2018, 560 ASR adults in 58 collective  accommodations in Germany's 3rd largest federal state were randomly sampled and  assessed. The parent-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was  used to assess child psychosocial functioning. SDQ dimensions (Emotional,  Conduct, Peer, Hyperactivity, Prosocial, Total) were compared by demographics  (sex, age, region of origin, time since arrival, subjective social status),  health status (long-lasting illness, physical limitation, pain) and healthcare  access (utilization: paediatrician, specialist, dentist, psychologist,  hospital/emergency department, prescribed medicines; and unmet needs: for  paediatrician/specialist, reduced spending to cover healthcare cost). Age and  sex-adjusted odds ratios (AOR, 95%CI-Confidence Intervals) for scoring in  borderline/abnormal ranges in SDQ dimensions were estimated through logistic  regression depending on children' health status and healthcare access.

Borderline/abnormal SDQ Emotional scores were positively  associated with a long-lasting illness (5.25, 1.57-17.55), physical limitation  (4.28, 1.49-12.27) and bodily pain (3.00, 1.10-8.22), and negatively associated  with visiting a paediatrician (0.23, 0.07-0.78), specialist (0.16, 0.04-0.69),  and the emergency department (0.27, 0.08-0.96). CONCLUSION: Poor psychosocial  functioning among ASR children is associated with somatic problems, unmet medical  needs, and lower healthcare utilisation.

However,  lack of experience in young children and concern that IGRAs are less sensitive  than tuberculin skin tests (TSTs) limit their use. Our aim was to identify active  tuberculosis (TB) cases among high risk children <5 years and tested for LTBI  with an IGRA. METHODS: . Retrospective review of domestic TB screening data from  California's Refugee Health Electronic Information System for children <5 years  old who resettled in California between October, 2013 and December, 2016.  Children were crossmatched with the California TB registry to identify cases of  TB disease between October 2013 and December 2018. RESULTS: A total of 3371  children <5 years were identified; the majority were born in countries with high  TB incidence (>150 cases per 100 000). Half received IGRAs (n = 1878; 56%), a  quarter received TSTs (n = 811; 24%); 1.4% of children were IGRA-positive (n =  26) and 13% were TST-positive (n = 106). Twenty-two IGRA results were  indeterminate (1.2%). Sixteen children had both tests; 9 were discrepant  (positive TST with negative IGRA). No cases of TB disease were identified during  10 797 person-years of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: IGRA positivity was less than TST  positivity in high risk children <5 years old. Despite fewer LTBI diagnoses in  the IGRA-tested population, no cases of TB disease among children who tested  negative were identified, suggesting IGRA is valuable tool for identifying LTBI  in this population.",Oct-20,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,e20200715,,4,146,,Pediatrics,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2020 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 32994177,,,,"Humans; Female; Male; Retrospective Studies; Child, Preschool; Refugees/*statistics & numerical data; Latent Tuberculosis/*diagnosis/epidemiology; Tuberculin Test/*statistics & numerical data; California/epidemiology; Interferon-gamma Release Tests/*statistics & numerical data",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PRS  children were integrated into existing schools run by the United Nations Relief  and Works Agency (UNRWA). Despite efforts by UNRWA to integrate the newly  displaced into its services in Lebanon, only 58% of 6-18-year-old PRS children  were enrolled in school in 2014. Informed by ecological systems theory, we  examined the role of parental characteristics in determining school enrollment  among PRS children following displacement into Lebanon. Utilizing data from the  2014 UNRWA Vulnerability Assessment (N = 12,378 6-18-year-old children), we  specified crude and adjusted logistic regression models to predict child school  non-enrollment including a set of variables on head of family characteristics  (gender, age, education, and presence/absence of chronic disease) and  post-displacement household characteristics (crowding, wealth, camp residence,  region, and type of dwelling). The results show that, adjusting for household  characteristics, a child living in a family whose head has secondary education or  higher is more likely to be enrolled in school compared to one living in a family  headed by someone with less than secondary education. Parental education remains  the strongest predictor of child school enrollment despite displacement-related  household disadvantage. To break the cycle of intergenerational educational  disadvantage, it is critical for UNRWA to proactively design school retention  programs for PRS children living in families whose head had limited access to  education.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive study. PARTICIPANTS: Syrian refugees 18 years  old or younger. METHODS: Five clinic days were organized from July 2016 to  November 2017 in Toronto, Ontario. A total of 274 patients were enrolled. Data  collection involved surveys, vision screening, and ocular examinations. χ(2) was  used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The prevalence of uncorrected vision was  17.2% for distance, 4.7% for near, and 0.7% for both distance and near vision,  including loss of vision. Of these, 95.3% had not visited an eye specialist in  the past year, and 25.2% of parents were dissatisfied with their children's  vision. The presenting visual acuity in the better-seeing eye was 20/50 or worse  in 5.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.6%-9.3%), and this did not correct with  pinhole.

This review aims to identify  preventive post settlement influences, including living arrangements, access to  mental health services, and effective treatments that may improve mental health  outcomes. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted of published  papers in any language for children (<18 years) entering a host country,  unaccompanied and seeking asylum. Specific studies were eligible if they examined  any treatment or nontreatment influences on mental health or psychological  resilience for the URM. Thirteen published quantitative studies were identified.  RESULTS: URMs in more supportive living arrangements including foster care had  lower risk of PTSD and lower depressive symptoms compared with those in  semi-independent care arrangements. URMs living in reception settings that  restricted freedom had more anxiety symptoms. Regarding help seeking, one study  found only 30% of URMs had foster parents or guardians who could detect a mental  health need. Two papers found the URMs had low levels of contact with mental  health services despite the high prevalence of psychiatric symptoms. URMs were  less likely than accompanied children to receive trauma-focused interventions,  cognitive therapy, or even practical assistance with basic social needs. With  regard to treatment evaluation, only case series were identified. Three studies  found cognitive behavioural therapy improved PTSD symptoms and mental health  outcomes. A less structured approach (mental health counselling alone) did not  improve functional health outcomes. CONCLUSION: Higher support living  arrangements with low restrictions are associated with lower psychological  distress. Most URMs are not receiving psychological interventions, and there is a  dearth of studies evaluating treatment effectiveness for this group.

Children constitute over half of  this population. A review of the currently available literature regarding the  psychological impact of forced displacement on children was performed with the  concept examined under three stages of flight: pre-migration, intra-migration and  post-migration. The resilience of children despite adversities is explored.  Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety are the most  commonly studied effects of forced migration on children. Rates range from 20 to  52.7%, 23 to 44.1% and 38.3 to 69% respectively. PTSD is associated with  pre-migration disturbances such as witnessing death or torture of relatives,  assaults and separation from family. Intra-migration difficulties relate to the  hazardous journey, length of detention, type of facility and failed asylum  application. Post-migration difficulties highlighted are insecure asylum status,  housing worries, multiple relocations and poor acculturation technique and are  more related to depression and anxiety. Despite these challenges and the  tremendous horror witnessed, the majority of children report good functionality  in their host countries in the long-term. The purpose of this report is to  provide an overview of the factors contributing to the manifestation of mental  health issues in child refugees as well as to examine mechanisms which enhance  successful resettling in the host society.

Recent U.S. policies have further embedded trauma in the  asylum-seeking process by forcing families to remain in Mexico, enduring dire  living conditions in tent encampments near the border while awaiting processing.  These families are now entering the United States in large numbers. This article  sheds light on their recent experiences and mental health needs, using a mixed  methods-grounded theory design, presenting quantitative and qualitative data to  describe the experiences of six asylum-seeking families who waited for 1-2 years  in the refugee camp in Mexico. METHOD: Quantitative data was obtained from the  Brief Symptom Inventory-18 and the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire while qualitative  interviews provided insight into reasons for migration and trauma at different  stages of the migration process. RESULTS: All participants experienced multiple  traumas and endorsed trauma related symptoms. Important themes of psychological  distress and trauma emerged, including unending suffering, hunger, and worry for  the safety of their children while living in the refugee camp. Asylum-seeking  families experienced substantial distress and trauma secondary to their stay in  Mexico and COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Families arriving to the United States have  experienced significant trauma, separation, and loss before and during their  journey. Interactions with an unprepared and overwhelmed immigration system  further compromises their psychological well-being.

Because of the risks associated with formula feeding, the  OG-IFE provides limited circumstances when infant formula should be provided in  aid. However, distributions against this guidance are common, reducing  breastfeeding so risking increased infant morbidity and mortality. This study  sought to identify factors that contributed to following ('good practice') or not  following ('poor practice') the OG-IFE regarding infant formula distribution in  the 2014-16 refugee crisis in Europe. Thirty-three individuals who supported,  coordinated, or implemented infant feeding support in the Crisis were interviewed  regarding their experiences and views. Reflexive thematic analysis of transcribed  interviews was undertaken. It was identified that presence of breastfeeding  support, presence of properly implemented formula feeding programmes,  understanding that maternal choice to formula feed should be considered within  the risk context of the emergency, and positive personal experiences of  breastfeeding contributed to good practice. Presence of infant formula donations,  absence of properly managed formula feeding programmes, belief that maternal  choice to formula feed is paramount and should be facilitated, and personal  experience of insurmountable breastfeeding challenges and/or formula feeding  contributed to poor practice. Governments, humanitarian organisations, and donors  should ensure that infant and young child feeding in emergencies preparedness and  programmes are adequately resourced. Emergency responders should be appropriately  trained with training including infant feeding experience debriefing. Health and  emergency organisations should provide maternity protections enabling employees  to breastfeed as recommended.",Jan-22,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,e13282,,1,18,,Matern Child Nutr,,,,,,,,eng,© 2021 The Authors.

Unaccompanied minors are a vulnerable population,  with numerous stressors and complex psychiatric symptoms necessitating  specialized mental health care. This study explores patients' experiences of a  Multimodal Co-Therapy for Unaccompanied Minors (MUCTUM), which encompasses  cultural, biological, narrative & institutional approaches to care. METHODS:  MUCTUM is a co-therapy program for unaccompanied minors, with a psychiatrist,  psychologist, native-language interpreter, and caseworker for each patient. In  this qualitative study, we interviewed adolescents about their experiences with  MUCTUM and analyzed these semi-structured interviews using a phenomenological  framework (Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis). RESULTS: Qualitative  analysis of 16 interviews discovered that unaccompanied minors felt misunderstood  before participating in MUCTUM, describing a sense of strangeness and loneliness  in relation to psychiatric symptoms. Several youths experienced triple  stigmatization: of being unaccompanied minors, of suffering from psychotrauma,  and of being mental health patients. We further describe three overarching  domains that inform on MUCTUM support to unaccompanied minors: (1) A safe space  for unaccompanied minors; (2) Helpful interventions during therapy; and (3)  Narrating one's story can ""set us free"" if guided carefully by care providers.  CONCLUSION: This study suggests that MUCTUM therapy may efficiently support  unaccompanied minors' mental health by acknowledging their hierarchy of needs.  Psychotherapeutic strategies include creating a safe place, providing culturally  appropriate care and patient-centered therapy, addressing concrete problems,  supporting relationships, and making use of limited reparenting in therapy.  Delayed and progressive inquiry about traumatic events may be beneficial.  Replication of these findings and their field application is warranted.",2022-11-07,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,81,,1,16,,Child Adolesc Psychiatry Ment Health,,,,,,,,eng,© 2022.

The healthcare needs of refugees have  placed strains on Greece's healthcare system which has already been affected by  its ongoing economic crisis. At the peak of arrivals during 2016, primary  healthcare was primarily provided by humanitarian organizations with specialist  referrals into the Greek healthcare system. There is little published literature  on the type and impacts of specialist referrals for refugees in Greece. The aim  of this retrospective review is to identify the type and impacts of specialist  referrals for refugees into Greece's health system. METHODS: This retrospective  study reviewed the number and type of specialty referrals from one humanitarian  organization providing primary healthcare for refugees in Greece. All  consultations during an 8-month period (December 1, 2016-July 31, 2017) were  reviewed. RESULTS: Of 4168 consultations, 42% were patients aged 17 years or  younger, 52% were male, and 90% were Syrian. Two hundred and thirty-three  patients (11%) required a specialist referral; 25% were for dental (provided by  another humanitarian organization), 10% each for obstetrics and gynecology and  pediatrics, and 8% for ophthalmology. Respiratory complaints were most frequently  seen, and these were more predominant in the winter months. Pediatric  consultations varied according to month, likely due to population movements.

Attempts to expand access to rehabilitation services have encountered barriers on  multiple levels: limited resources on the systemic level, hierarchies on the  professional level, and cultural stigma on the community level. OBJECTIVES: We  sought to determine if an academic-community partnership could overcome multiple  levels of barriers to expand services for people with disabilities. METHODS:  Toward an All-Inclusive Jordan incorporates community-based rehabilitation with  prelicensure health professions education to address the three primary levels of  barriers to rehabilitation services in low- and middle-income countries.

Parenting interventions for refugees emphasize the  acquisition of parenting knowledge and skills, while overlooking the deleterious  effects of chronic stress on parenting. War Child Holland's Caregiver Support  Intervention (CSI) aims to strengthen parenting by lowering stress and improving  psychosocial wellbeing among refugee parents, while also increasing knowledge and  skill related to positive parenting. The CSI is a nine-session group intervention  delivered by non-specialist providers. OBJECTIVE: We describe the findings of a  two-arm pilot randomized controlled trial of the CSI with Syrian refugees in  Lebanon. The primary aim was to test the feasibility of our study methodology  prior to conducting a definitive RCT. METHODS: We recruited 78 families (151  parents), who were randomized to the CSI or a waitlist control group. Data were  collected at baseline and post-intervention. RESULTS: Randomization was  successful, retention was high (99 %), as was intervention completion (95 % among  women, 86 % among men). Implementation fidelity was excellent. Blinding was  largely, though not completely effective. The CSI group showed significantly  increased parental warmth and responsiveness, decreased harsh parenting, lowered  stress and distress, improved psychosocial wellbeing, and improved stress  management. CSI parents reported increased child psychosocial wellbeing. Control  families showed no significant change on any variable. CONCLUSIONS: Findings  demonstrate the feasibility of our methodology for a definitive RCT, and suggest  that the CSI shows promise as a scalable approach to strengthening parenting in  refugee communities.

Within a sample of Somali young adults (18-30, N = 185) resettled in North  America, this study tested whether two acculturation styles (assimilation and  integration) longitudinally mediate the relation between discrimination and three  mental health outcomes (i.e., anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress  disorder), and whether gender moderated these relations. Discrimination had a  direct, positive relation with future mental health symptoms for females, which  was not mediated by acculturation strategy. By contrast, the association between  discrimination and mental health outcomes for males was fully mediated by  increased endorsement of assimilation, but not integration. Experiences of  marginalization may erode connections to both the Somali community and to the  nation of resettlement, which have been identified as particularly strong  protective forces within this community.

Syrian refugees provide an example of people who migrated because of a  single major event: the war in Syria. The article examines the impact of the  COVID-19 pandemic on fathering practices. The Swedish COVID-19 strategy differed  from those adopted in many other countries. Lockdowns were minimal and were not  stringently enforced, based on the assumption that individuals would trust the  authorities and would take personal responsibility for complying with their  guidelines and recommendations. Previous research suggests that migrants and  other vulnerable groups were not always well informed about the public policies  introduced prior to and during the pandemic. The article draws on empirical data  from a wider research project on the family lives of Syrian migrants in Sweden.  The authors present their findings from an analysis of eleven ethnographically  informed semi-structured interviews, carried out before and during the pandemic,  with married fathers who had been living in Sweden for several years. In this  article, they focus on three cases representing fathers with varied educational  backgrounds and employment histories. These families had in common what are  considered by Swedish standards to be overcrowded living conditions; they were  forced to accept close family proximity, both physically and emotionally, as they  no longer had the supportive networks they were used to in Syria. The three  fathers were found to rely more heavily on information provided by the people  with whom they were in contact in Sweden than on policies and recommendations  from the authorities. These findings confirmed that the previous experiences  among refugees of shifting policies regarding migration and integration had  lowered their trust in government. They had learnt that they needed to rely on  mutual dependency not only between spouses, but also between parents and  children.",2021,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,721881,,,6,,Front Sociol,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2021 Wissö and Bäck-Wiklund.,,,,,,Place: Switzerland PMID: 34458362  PMCID: PMC8385311,,,,COVID-19; ethnographic approach; fathering practices; lockdown measures; Syrian refugees in Sweden,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Turkey hosts the highest number of Syrian refugees in the world. By  February 2019 over 3.6 million people had fled to Turkey to seek safety. Only  6.1% of Syrian refugees live in temporary shelters. Owing to the disrupted  healthcare services, many children coming from the conflict zones are less likely  to have received vaccination.

Overall in Turkey, 7794 cutaneous leishmaniasis have been reported.  IMPLICATIONS: Since the influx of Syrian refugees, there has been an increase in  cases of leishmaniasis and measles. No significant increase was detected for  tuberculosis, other vector-borne infections, and healthcare associated or  sexually transmitted infections.

Therefore, this  study aimed to explore traditional food patterns and eating habits among  Sub-Saharan African migrant mothers of school-aged children in South Australia.  The study was a qualitative inquiry that used face-to-face interviews with 15  mothers of school-aged children in South Australia. Snowballing was used to  sample participants, and data were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, coded,  and analysed thematically. Four broad themes described participants' food  behaviours and eating habits, including maintaining traditional food patterns,  changes in traditional food patterns and eating habits, concerns with food  environments in Australia, and challenges with traditional food availability and  access in Australia. This study found that although mothers were committed to  maintaining their traditional foods, they found it increasingly difficult to  continue such habits. Participants reported challenges as their children are  increasingly demanding westernised foods. While some parents pushed back against  such demands from their children, others felt helpless and relented. Some views  showed that food environments, food systems, access, and scarcity of traditional  foods in Australia influenced the participants' food patterns and eating habits.  Appropriately tailored healthy eating health promotion actions targeting  school-aged children and mothers in this population need to consider their food  contexts.

The review was focused on  studies of first-generation and second-generation immigrant children aged 0-18  years. We completed standardised data extraction of immigration status,  immigration route, age of children, data source, health or clinical focus,  country of origin and major findings. RESULTS: In total, 250 published papers  representing data from 237 studies met the inclusion criteria for this study.

However, collecting robust scientific evidence, and ensuring contextual  relevance, is challenging. We measured the biological, psychosocial, and  cognitive impacts of a structured psychosocial intervention, implemented by Mercy  Corps with Syrian refugees and Jordanian host-community youth. In this paper, we  present a case analysis of this evaluation study and reflect on the scientific  contributions of the work, the challenges experienced in its delivery, and the  strategies deployed to address them. DISCUSSION: We identified challenges with  respect to study design, methods, and dissemination: these included the logistics  and acceptability of implementing a randomized controlled trial in a humanitarian  context, the selection and refinement of culturally-relevant research tools and  community-based practices, and the dissemination of results to multiple  stakeholders. We demonstrated beneficial and sustained impacts on self-reports of  insecurity, stress, and mental health; developed a reliable and  culturally-relevant measure of resilience; experimentally tested cognitive  skills; and showed that levels of cortisol, a biomarker of chronic stress,  reduced by one third in response to intervention. Using stress biomarkers offered  proof-of-concept evidence, beyond self-reported data: interventions targeting  mental health and psychosocial wellbeing can regulate physiological stress in the  body as well as improve self-reported mental health and wellbeing. We built  constructive dialogue between local communities, scholars, humanitarian  practitioners, and policy-makers. CONCLUSIONS: Our work shows the value of  rigorous research in humanitarian settings, emphasizing relevance for local  communities and meaningful ways to build research ownership. Findings encourage  the adoption of cognitive measures and stress biomarkers alongside self-report  surveys in evaluating programme impacts.

This created for URMs a  challenging situation of living ""in limbo"" uncertain about their future awaiting  for a long time the outcome of their asylum application. This cross-sectional  study aimed to explore the mental health of URMs, who arrived in Greece in 2016.  The sample comprised 90 URMs (76 boys), aged 13-17 years, consisting of 46  Syrians and 44 originating from other countries. Participants completed  socio-demographic information and a range of clinical measures, including  Children's Revised Impact of Events Scale (CRIES), Depression Self-Rating Scale  (DSRS), Children's Post-Traumatic Cognitions Inventory (cPTCI), a measure of  trauma exposure and perceived social support. Syrian URMs were significantly more  likely than URMs originating from other countries to score within the probable  clinical depression range (71.7% versus 47.7% respectively, p=0.020), to display  probable posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), i.e., score within clinically  significant range of posttraumatic stress symptoms and negative post-trauma  cognitions (87% versus 65.9%, p=0.018), and meet the comorbidity PTSD/depression  criterion (65.2% versus 40.9%, p=0.021).

The total number of stressful/traumatic  experiences and male gender were found to be significantly related only with  posttraumatic symptoms severity score (β=0.29, p=0.003), whereas lower levels of  perceived social support were associated with increased levels of depressive  symptoms (β=0.24, p=0.018) and negative cognitions and appraisals of the world  and the self (β=0.26, p=0.008).

Although endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial  needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) has been found useful for the evaluation of  mediastinal pathologies in adults, for children, sparse data are available. Here,  we have evaluated EBUS-TBNA as a diagnostic procedure in children and adolescents  with suspected pulmonary Tb. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, we reviewed  the charts of unaccompanied refugee minors (URM) who were admitted between  January 2016 and July 2018 and who, during their initial medical screening upon  arrival in Germany, were found to have abnormal radiological pulmonary and  mediastinal findings and/or immunological results indicative of Tb. For each  patient, basic sociodemographic data, clinical features and data on diagnostic  procedures performed were assessed. These included imaging, immunodiagnostic  tests and microbiological data derived from sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage,  EBUS-TBNA, bronchoscopy and pleural fluid sampling. All patients who underwent  invasive sampling procedures were included in the study. RESULTS: Out of 42 URM  with suspected Tb, 34 fulfilled the study's inclusion criteria. Ages ranged from  14 to 17 years. All were of African origin, with 70.0% coming from Somalia,  Eritrea and Ethiopia. Among the 21 patients for whom EBUS-TBNA was performed, the  diagnostic yield was high: 66.7% positive results (MTb detected either by  acid-fast stain, culture or PCR in 4.8, 42.9 and 61.9% of samples, respectively).  Multidrug-resistant MTb was found in two patients from Somalia. No complications  were associated with the procedure. Overall, pulmonary Tb was diagnosed in 29  patients (85.3%), miliary Tb in two patients (5.9%) and latent Tb in three  patients (8.8%).

More than every third child in Germany has a  migrant background. In the city of Bremen, this figure is even higher, including  refugee children. The availability of comprehensive data on the provision and  uptake of speech and language therapy (SLT) services is still inadequate,  especially for multilingual children. However, health-monitoring programs report  that migrants differ in many health-related areas from the majority population,  mainly in barriers in health care. This study examines the current provision of  SLT services for multilingual children following a medical prescription for the  specific case of suspected language disorder. Information was obtained from  speech-language pathologists (SLPs) representing 28 practices in different  districts across one of the moderately largest cities affected by sociospatial  polarization. The SLT practices were clustered according to the proportion of  minor migrants and minor welfare recipients in the district. The survey included  the number and proportion of multilingual children on the SLT caseloads, as well  as the age of children by time of referral, physician and SLP diagnoses,  application and type of assessment materials, intervention goals, and  sociodemographic data of practicing SLPs. Questionnaire responses were analyzed  using descriptive statistics and an explanatory interpretive approach. Findings  suggest that multilingual children experience later referral compared to  monolingual German-speaking children, with approximately half of the multilingual  children demonstrating a developmental language disorder (DLD). The SLP's level  of experience determines the accuracy of differential diagnosis between  communication disorders and typical linguistic variations. Consequently,  participation in continuing education focusing on service provision of the  multilingual and multicultural clientele is essential. This study highlights the  obstacles and the needs for increased multiprofessional awareness and an enhanced  professional knowledge to provide effective and swift diagnosis earlier to allow  multilingual children with a DLD to access relevant services on equal terms with  native resident children.",2019,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,116-126,,03-Feb,71,,Folia Phoniatr Logop,,,,,,,,eng,"© 2019 S.

There is  currently no donor milk bank in Turkey. For any new health intervention to be  successful, determining its acceptability is a vital first step. This study  intends to determine the opinions, knowledge, and attitudes of native Turkish and  refugee women living in Çeştepe, Aydın, a rural area in Turkey, about HMB.  METHODS: A population-based cross-sectional, mixed-methods study was conducted.  Qualitative study data were collected through in-depth interviews with 33 women,  and quantitative study data were collected using a questionnaire. A total of 271  women in the region were included in the study. Qualitative data were  thematically analyzed and then a conceptual framework was created. Logistic  regression was performed for quantitative data. RESULTS: Fifty-seven point nine  per cent of the women were willing to donate breast milk, whereas only 27.7% were  willing to use donor milk for their babies. Religious concerns, fear of  infectious diseases, and distrust in people they did not know were among the  reasons for the negative attitudes of the women. Fear of infectious diseases was  mentioned specifically by native Turkish women, and religious concerns were  reported both by native Turkish and refugee women. The importance of breast milk  and religion were among the reasons for positive attitudes. Additionally, odds of  having a positive attitude were 4.19 times higher in homemaker women (95% CI 2.0,  8.76); 4.77 times higher in women with three or more children (95% CI 1.25,  8.15); 6.12 times higher in women who had a positive attitude towards wet nursing  (95% CI 3.14, 9.63); and 2.68 times higher in those who had previously heard  about human milk banking (95% CI 1.24, 5.79). CONCLUSION: Attitudes towards HMB  are affected by religion, cultural beliefs, and concerns about the safety of  breast milk in HMBs. Refugees and native Turkish women are found to have similar  religious concerns. These findings should be taken into consideration in human  milk banking initiatives and in activities to increase acceptance by the public.",2022-10-27,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,74,,1,17,,Int Breastfeed J,,,,,,,,eng,© 2022.

One of the first mobile  health (m-Health) interventions in a refugee setting, the application gives  pregnant women and mothers access to educational information and health records  on smartphones. This study investigated factors associated with the dissemination  and implementation of m-Health in the refugee setting. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS:  A cross-sectional study was conducted in 9 of 25 UNRWA health centres for  Palestine refugees in Jordan. Self-administered questionnaires were distributed  for 1 week to pregnant women and mothers with children aged 0-5 years. OUTCOME  MEASURES: The outcomes were whether participants knew about, downloaded or used  the application. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine factors  associated with application download and usage. RESULTS: 1042 participants were  included in the analysis. 979 (95.5%) had a mobile phone and 862 (86.9%) had a  smartphone. 499 (51.3%) knew about, 235 (23.8%) downloaded and 172 (17.4%) used  the application. Having other mobile applications (OR 6.17, p<0.01), staff  knowledge of the application (OR 11.82, p<0.01), using the internet as a source  of medical information (OR 1.63, p=0.01) and having internet access at home (OR  1.46, p=0.05) were associated with application download. The age of the husband  was associated with application usage (OR 1.04, p=0.11). CONCLUSIONS: Though  m-Health may be a promising means of promoting health in refugees, multiple  barriers may exist to its dissemination and implementation. Those who regularly  use mobile applications and get medical information from the internet are  potential targets of m-Health dissemination. For successful implementation of a  m-Health intervention, health staff should have thorough knowledge of the  application and users should have access to the internet.

We tested the effects of a  group-based intervention, the Mother-Child Education Program (MOCEP), on  parenting stress and practices among two refugee communities and one other  marginalized community in Beirut, Lebanon. METHOD: A pilot wait-list RCT was  conducted to assess the program's impact on maternal, child (average age: 4  years), and dyadic outcomes. A total of 106 mother-child dyads were randomly  assigned to either the intervention group (n = 53) or the wait-list control group  (n = 53). Analysis was conducted by modified intention-to-treat and supplemental  analyses through multiple imputation of missing post-intervention data. RESULTS:  Forty families (38%) withdrew early from the study. After completing the program,  mothers in the intervention group showed a reduction in their harsh parenting  practices, as indexed by the Disciplinary Style Questionnaire (Cohen's d = -0.76,  95% CI = -1.24, -0.27) and in their level of parenting stress, as indexed by the  Parenting Stress Index-Short Form (PSI-SF; Cohen's d = -0.90, 95%  CI = -1.39, -0.40). Exploratory but underpowered analyses of dyadic interactions  revealed reductions in the PSI were associated with a reduction in harsh  parenting after the intervention. However, we did not detect any positive impact  on behavioral or emotional outcomes among the children. CONCLUSION: Our analyses  suggest that MOCEP had a positive impact on disciplinary practices and parenting  stress in a context of high fragility, but that broader effects on maternal and  child outcomes may be dependent on program attendance and the availability of  other services. We discuss implications of this pilot study for practice and  research of a largely unexplored area of program evaluation.

In many countries, the proportion of  infected children in the total population is comparatively low; in addition,  children often have no or milder symptoms and are less likely to transmit the  pathogen to adults than the other way round. Based on the registration data in  Frankfurt am Main, Germany, the symptoms of children in comparison with adults  and the likely routes of transmission are presented below. Materials and methods:  The documentation of the mandatory reports includes personal data (name, date of  birth, gender, place of residence), disease characteristics (date of report, date  of onset of the disease, symptoms), possible contact persons (family, others) and  i.a. possible activity or care in children's community facilities. All reports  were viewed, especially with regard to likely transmission routes. Results: From  March 1 to July 31, 2020, 1,977 infected people were reported, including 138  children between the ages of 0 and 14 years. Children had fewer and milder  symptoms than adults. None of the children experienced severe respiratory  symptoms or the need for ventilation. 62% of the children had no symptoms at all  (19% adults), 5% of the children were hospitalized (24% adults), and none of the  children died (3.8% adults). After excluding a cluster of 34 children from  refugee accommodations and 14 children from a parish, 78% of the remaining 90  children had been infected by an adult within the family, and only 4% were likely  to have a reverse transmission route. In 5.5% of cases, transmission in a  community facility was likely. Discussion: The results of the registration data  from Frankfurt am Main, Germany confirm the results published in other countries:  Children are less likely to become infected, and if infected, their symptoms are  less severe than in adults, and they are apparently not the main drivers of virus  transmission. Therefore, scientific medical associations strongly recommend  reopening schools.",2020,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,Doc24,,,15,,GMS Hyg Infect Control,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2020 Heudorf et al.,,,,,,Place: Germany PMID: 33214989  PMCID: PMC7656974,,,,SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; children; mandatory reporting; public health department; symptoms; transmission routes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Depression  prevalence and associated sociodemographic and displacement characteristics have  been reported for resettled migrants. However, the prevalence of major depressive  disorder (MDD) and its risk factors have not been described among migrants  engaged in the asylum process ensuing from the Syrian crisis. This study provides  new data about the mental health status of migrants in transition in the context  of protracted asylum procedures. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey  in a Syrian refugee camp in the Attica region of Greece from January 16-31, 2017.  Individuals ≥18 years of age with verbal Arabic or English language skills were  eligible to participate. The Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8), an  eight-item validated diagnostic and severity measure, was used to screen for MDD.  We analysed the relationships between MDD and sociodemographic and displacement  characteristics using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 135  surveys were completed, representing 40% of the adult population in the refugee  camp. The mean age of the participants was 30 years (18-61 years); women  comprised 41% of the sample; 74% of the participants had ever married; 67% had  children; and 33% of participants had not attended secondary school, including  11% who had never attended school. Median time since departing the country of  origin was 12 months (< 1-74 months). Median time spent in the asylum process in  Greece was 10 months (< 1-49 months). MDD was detected in 44% (95% CI: 37-50) of  participants. Being a woman (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]: 3.23, p = 0.019), each  additional child (AOR: 1.61, p = 0.006), and increased time in the asylum process  in Greece (AOR: 1.15, p = 0.043) were significant risk factors for MDD. Ever  being married was associated with reduced odds of MDD (AOR: 0.23, p = 0.042).  CONCLUSIONS: Syrian migrants face an extraordinarily high burden of MDD as they  seek asylum. Incorporation of screening and treatment into service provision  within refugee camps is urgently needed, particularly as migrants spend extended  periods of time in transition due to protracted asylum procedures.",2018-07-24,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,908,,1,18,,BMC Public Health,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 30041693  PMCID: PMC6056929,,,,"Humans; Adult; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Female; Cross-Sectional Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Adolescent; Young Adult; Syria/ethnology; Sex Factors; Logistic Models; Surveys and Questionnaires; Depression; Greece/epidemiology; Marital Status; Family Characteristics; Refugees; Migrants; *Refugee Camps; Transients and Migrants; Global mental health; Conflict; *Emigration and Immigration/legislation & jurisprudence; Depression/epidemiology/*etiology; Depressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis/epidemiology/*etiology; Refugees/legislation & jurisprudence/*psychology/statistics & numerical data",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Swiss guidelines recommend vaccinating patients native from endemic areas. In Geneva's Children's hospital,  migrant children are screened and vaccinated if seronegative. Because hepatitis  A's prevalence is decreasing worldwide, more children are seronegative at  arrival, highlighting the need for immunization in medical centers and refugee  camps and questioning the benefits of systematic serology. Other Swiss hospitals  vaccinate regardless of serostatus. This study's aim is to assess migrant  children's immunity according to origin and age, and the cost-effectiveness of  different immunization strategies. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 329  children's serostatus (1-16 years of age) between 2012 and 2015, using  enzyme-linked fluorescent assay method. Serology and vaccine costs were based on  local prices. Groups were compared with χ test and the age-seropositivity  relationship was studied with linear regression. RESULTS: The predominant regions  were the Eastern Mediterranean and European Regions with mostly negative  serologies (71% and 83%) and the African Region with mostly positive serologies  (79%). Immunity varied depending on birth country. Regardless of region,  seropositivity increased with age (P < 0.001). The most cost-effective  vaccination strategy was an individualized approach based on age and origin,  reducing costs by 2% compared with serology-guided immunization and by 17%  compared with systematic vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Many migrant children >5 years  old are seronegative and at risk of clinical infection. They need to be  immunized. New guidelines according to age and origin should be defined to reduce  immunization costs. We recommend systematic vaccination for patients <5 years old  or native from low endemicity areas (≤25.7% of seropositivity). For the others,  we propose serology-based vaccination.",Feb-20,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,164-169,,2,39,,Pediatr Infect Dis J,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 31929432,,,,"Humans; Female; Male; Retrospective Studies; Child; Adolescent; Child, Preschool; Infant; *Transients and Migrants; Mass Screening; Immunization Programs; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Public Health Surveillance; Switzerland/epidemiology; *Vaccination/economics/methods; Hepatitis A Vaccines/administration & dosage/economics/*immunology; Hepatitis A/*epidemiology/*prevention & control/transmission",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Few  studies are anchored in general developmental psychology with the aim of  exploring normal age-specific developmental tasks and how the special  circumstances associated with forced migration can influence that development.  METHODS: Using an ecological and transactional understanding of developmental  trajectories, this qualitative study explored issues connected to identity  formation processes in an exile context based on interviews with 6 male and 10  female children of refugees (18-26 years) who have grown up in Norway. RESULTS:  The findings show that family experiences of war and conflict intersect with  experiences of marginalization in exile. The interaction of these experiences  influences the development of individual identity in cumulative and complex ways.  Many of the participants expressed feelings of isolation, disconnectedness, and a  lack of belonging. Nevertheless, though the participants described growing up  facing major challenges, they also searched for ways to reframe their difficult  personal and family histories into meaningful experiences. CONCLUSIONS: In order  to provide conditions and develop interventions that can support well-being and  identity development, we need a better understanding of the different forces that  influence the identity development of children of refugees. By foregrounding the  participants' experiences, and perspectives, we gained insight into different  ways in which participants negotiate identity issues in relation to often  contradictory demands and messages from family and the wider social context.",Apr-20,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,09-Jan,,,80,,J Adolesc,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2020 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

Oral cholera vaccines are safe and can effectively be used as an  adjunct to prevent cholera in settings with limited access to water and  sanitation. Results from this study can inform future consideration for cholera  vaccination at Kakuma and Kalobeyei. METHODS: a descriptive cross-sectional study  of cholera cases at Kakuma refugee camp and Kalobeyei integrated settlement was  carried out between May 2017 to May 2018 (one year). Data were extracted from the  medical records and line lists at the cholera treatment centres. RESULTS: the  results found 125 clinically suspected and confirmed cholera cases and one  related death (CFR 0.8%). The cumulative incidence of all cases was 0.67 (95%  CI=0.56-0.80) cases/1000 persons. Incidence of cholera was higher in children  under the age of five 0.94(95% CI=0.63-1.36) cases/1000 persons.

It is, therefore, essential that  low-burden countries provide healthcare services to immigrant and refugee  families, to assure that their children can receive proper testing, evaluation,  and treatment for TB. Active case-finding through contact tracing is a critical  element of TB prevention in children and in finding TB disease at an early,  easily treated stage. Passive case-finding by evaluating an ill child is often  delayed, as other, more common infections and conditions are suspected initially.  While high-quality laboratory services to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis are  generally available, they are often underutilized in the diagnosis of childhood  TB, further delaying diagnosis in some cases. Performing research on TB disease  is difficult because of the low number of cases that are spread over many  locales, but critical research on the evaluation and treatment of TB infection  has been an important legacy of low-burden countries. The continued education of  medical providers and the involvement of educational, professional, and  non-governmental organizations is a key element of maintaining awareness of the  presence of TB. This article provides the perspective from North America and  Western Europe but is relevant to many low-endemic settings.

Following the Syrian refugee crisis and  insufficient clean water in the region, this study reviews the etiological and  epidemiological data in Lebanon. METHODS: We prospectively analyzed demographic,  clinical and routine laboratory data of 198 children from the age of 1 month to  10 years old who were admitted with the diagnosis of AGE to a private tertiary  care hospital located in the district of Nabatieh in south Lebanon. RESULTS:  Males had a higher incidence of AGE (57.1%). Pathogens were detected in 57.6%  (n=114) of admitted patients, among them single pathogens were found in 51.0%  (n=101) of cases that consisted of: Entamoeba histolytica 26.3% (n=52), rotavirus  18.7% (n=37), adenovirus 6.1% (n=12) and mixed co-pathogens found in 6.6% (n=13).

OBJECTIVES: Explore the barriers and  facilitators to the integration of health services for refugees; the processes  involved and the different stakeholders engaged in levaraging intersectoral  approaches to protect refugees' right to health on resettlement. DESIGN: Scoping  review. METHODS: A search of articles from 2000 onward was done in MEDLINE, Web  of Science, Global Health and PsycINFO, Embase. Two frameworks were applied in  our analysis, the 'framework for analysing integration of targeted health  interventions in systems' and 'Health in All Policies' framework for country  action. A comprehensive description of the methods is included in our published  protocol. RESULTS: 6117 papers were identified, only 18 studies met the inclusion  criteria. Facilitators in implementation included: training for providers,  colocation of services, transportation services to enhance access, clear role  definitions and appropriate budget allocation and financing. Barriers included:  lack of a participatory approach, insufficient resources for providers, absence  of financing, unclear roles and insufficient coordination of interprofessional  teams; low availability and use of data, and turf wars across governance  stakeholders. Successful strategies to address refugee health included: networks  of service delivery combining existing public and private services; system  navigators; host community engagement to reduce stigma; translation services;  legislative support and alternative models of care for women and children.  CONCLUSION: Limited evidence was found overall. Further research on intersectoral  approaches is needed.

However, not all trauma-exposed individuals exhibit mental health or  family dysfunction, and some function better than expected given their level of  trauma exposure. Research with at-risk populations, including refugees, suggests  that social support may promote positive mental health and parenting behavior in  the face of adversity. We used cross-sectional data from 291 Syrian refugee  mothers to test the role of perceived social support in promoting their  psychological and parenting resilience, defined here as better than expected  mental health and parenting behavior given level of exposure to war trauma.  Psychological and parenting resilience were operationalized using the residual  approach, which assesses the difference between mothers' actual score on mental  health and harsh discipline measures, and the score predicted by their level of  trauma exposure. Linear regression models were used to test for associations  between mothers' perceived social support and their psychological and parenting  resilience. Results showed that mothers' perceived social support was associated  with both psychological and parenting resilience, including after controlling for  covariates. Exploratory analyses further suggested that emotional support, but  not instrumental support, was associated with mothers' psychological resilience.  Social support may have a promotive effect on mothers' mental health and  parenting behavior in a context of ongoing conflict and displacement.

METHODS: We  established two healthy kitchens in existing community-based organizations in  Palestinian camps in Lebanon. These were set up as small business enterprises,  using participatory approaches to develop recipes and train women in food  preparation, food safety and entrepreneurship. We used a mixed-methods approach  to assess the impact of participating in the program on women's economic, food  security, decision making, social and mental health outcomes. A questionnaire was  administered to women at baseline and at an 8-month endpoint. The end line survey  was complemented by a set of embedded open-ended questions. RESULTS: Thirty-two  Palestinian refugee women were employed within the kitchens on a rotating basis.  Participating women had a 13% increase in household expenditure.

However, current data on the care of refugees and migrants in  initial reception centers is pending. This article provides data on prescription  frequencies of various antibiotics and associated diagnoses. METHODS: In this  retrospective observational study, patient data of 3255 patients with 6376  medical contacts in two initial reception centers in Germany were analyzed.  Patient data, collected by chart review, included sociodemographic  characteristics, diagnoses, and prescriptions. Antibiotic prescription behavior  and corresponding physician-coded diagnoses were analyzed. RESULTS: Nineteen  percent of all patients in our study received systemic antibiotics during the  observation period, with children below the age of 10 years receiving antibiotics  most frequently (24%). The most commonly prescribed antibiotics were penicillins  (65%), macrolides (12%), and cephalosporins (7%). The most frequent diagnoses  associated with antibiotic prescription were acute tonsillitis (26%), bronchitis  (21%), infections of the upper respiratory tract (14%), and urinary tract  infections (10%). In case of acute bronchitis 74% of the antibiotic prescriptions  were probably not indicated. In addition, we found a significant number of  inappropriate prescriptions such as amoxicillin for tonsillitis (67%), and  ciprofloxacin and cotrimoxazol for urinary tract infections (49%). CONCLUSION:  Regarding inappropriate prescription of antibiotics in refugee healthcare, this  study shows a rate ranging from 8% for upper respiratory tract infections to 75%  for acute bronchitis.

The postwar lack of health care infrastructure in Iraq has also resulted in Iraqis  seeking health care in neighboring countries. Pediatric cancer is largely  curable, although its treatment is expensive and complex. Strategies to implement  pediatric cancer care with curative intent in these vulnerable populations are  lacking. METHODS: To assess the feasibility of a collaborative approach for the  provision of care to displaced children with cancer, this study reviewed the  experience of the authors over the past 6 years in Lebanon, the country with the  highest number of refugees per capita in the world. RESULTS: The American  University of Beirut Medical Center and the Children's Cancer Center of Lebanon  Foundation, in partnership with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and the  American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities, established 3 successive funding  programs to treat displaced children with cancer along with a continuous  assessment of resource utilization. Between 2011 and 2017, 575 non-Lebanese  children suspected to have cancer were evaluated. Of those, 311 received direct  medical support, with 107 receiving full-treatment coverage and 204 receiving  limited-workup/specialty services; the remaining 264 patients received medical  consultations. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to providing lifesaving humanitarian  support, the coordination of care delivery, including the establishment of  guidelines for prioritization, can help direct future efforts.

Adelante was implemented and evaluated by the Avance Center for the  Advancement of Immigrant/Refugee Health, which built on a university-community  partnership that has been in place since 2005. Using a tailored, ecological  positive youth development (PYD) approach, Adelante employed intervention  strategies across ecological levels, including individual, family, peer, and  community levels, with the use of social marketing and digital media strategies  to link activities under one aspirational identity and support community  engagement. METHOD: Using a Community Based Participatory Research approach with  multiple community partners involved in the effort, the research assessed changes  in co-occurring behavioral outcomes and tested hypotheses concerning  relationships between PYD mediators and these outcomes. Multiple methods were  used in collaboration with partners to assess intervention inputs and  outcomes-detailed implementation process records; prepost surveys to assess  changes in PYD assets, risk behavior knowledge, and prevention skills; a  community survey in the intervention and comparison communities (total N = 3,600)  at baseline and two follow-up waves; surveys of a high risk cohort (n = 238) at  baseline and follow-up; and social marketing campaign surveys (n = 1,549) at  baseline with 2 follow-up waves. RESULTS: Analysis showed multiple improvements  in PYD mediators and risk behavior outcomes, including an overall 70% increase in  knowledge and a 15% increase in prevention skills. Preliminary analysis of risk  behavior outcomes demonstrated, for example, a significant, inverse effect on  reported sexual activity (past 3 months) for both Adelante intervention community  and cohort samples. In addition, self-reported exposure to the social marketing  campaign was associated with positive effects on multiple outcomes, including  drug use risk and violence attitudes, and improvement in violence/sexual risk  behavior outcomes in the intervention versus comparison community. CONCLUSION:  There are few models in the literature that provide a roadmap for how to address  multiple, related health conditions in marginalized, immigrant communities, even  as most health disparities are associated with complex social ecologies. The  Adelante intervention adds a useful model of this nature to the evidence base,  and provides support for the ecological approach to PYD with respect to such  communities.

Those who are socially or culturally marginalised  may face additional challenges in navigating health care, contributing to health  inequity. The aim of this study was to understand health system navigation,  including the role of technology, for young people belonging to one or more  marginalised groups, in order to inform youth health policy in New South Wales,  Australia. METHODS: This qualitative longitudinal study involved 2-4 interviews  each over 6 to 12 months with marginalised young people aged 12-24 years living  in NSW. The analysis used Nvivo software and grounded theory. RESULTS: We  interviewed 41 young people at baseline who were living in rural or remote areas,  sexuality and/or gender diverse, refugee, homeless, and/or Aboriginal. A  retention rate of over 85% was achieved. Nineteen belonged to more than one  marginalised group allowing an exploration of intersectionality. General  practitioners (family physicians) were the most commonly accessed service  throughout the study period. Participants were ambivalent about their healthcare  journeys. Qualitative analysis identified five themes: 1. Technology brings  opportunities to understand, connect and engage with services 2. Healthcare  journeys are shaped by decisions weighing up convenience, engagement,  effectiveness and affordability. 3. Marginalised young people perceive and  experience multiple forms of discrimination leading to forgone care. 4. Multiple  marginalisation makes health system navigation more challenging 5. The impact of  health system complexity and fragmentation may be mitigated by system knowledge  and navigation support CONCLUSIONS: The compounding effects of multiple  discrimination and access barriers were experienced more strongly for young  people belonging to mutiple marginalised groups. We identify several areas for  improving clinical practice and policy. Integrating technology and social media  into processes that facilitate access and navigation, providing respectful and  welcoming services that recognise diversity, improving health literacy and  involving professionals in advocacy and navigation support may help to address  these issues.",2019-03-04,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,41,,1,18,,Int J Equity Health,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 30832651  PMCID: PMC6399978,,,,Humans; Female; Qualitative Research; Male; Child; Adolescent; Young Adult; New South Wales; Longitudinal Studies; Health Policy; Delivery of Health Care/*organization & administration; Adolescents; *Health Services Accessibility; Access to health care; Health system navigation; Technologies; Young people; *Health Equity; *Social Marginalization; Marginalised youth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Population-based longitudinal  cohort study from 1996 to 2012 using linked health and administrative datasets.  SETTING: Ontario, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Youth 10-24 years, living in Ontario,  Canada. EXPOSURE: The main exposure was immigration status (recent immigrants vs  long-term residents). Secondary exposures were region of origin and refugee  status. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Mental health hospitalisations, emergency  department (ED) visits and outpatient visits within consecutive 3-year time  periods. Poisson regression models estimated rate ratios (RR). RESULTS: Over  2.5 million person years per period were included. Rates of recent immigrant  mental health service utilisation were at least 40% lower than long-term  residents (p<0.0001).Mental health hospitalisation and ED visit rates increased  in long-term residents (hospitalisations, RR 1.09 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.09); ED  visits, RR 1.15 (1.14 to 1.15)) and recent immigrants (hospitalisations RR 1.05  (1.03 to 1.07); ED visits, RR 1.08 (1.05 to 1.11)).

METHODS: This study utilised the Quarterly Immigration Detention  Health Reports over a period of 3 years. To compare onshore and offshore  datasets, we calculated the rate of health events per quarter against the  estimated quarterly onshore and offshore detention population of children. We ran  a series of two-proportion z-tests for each matched quarter to calculate median z  and P values for all quarters. These were used as an indicator as to whether the  observed differences between onshore and offshore events were statistically  significant. RESULTS: The estimated number of children detained per quarter  onshore ranged from 700 in 2014 (quarter 3) to 13 in 2016 (quarters 3 and 4); the  estimated quarterly population of children in offshore detention ranged from 186  in 2014 (quarter 3) to 42 in 2017 (quarter 2). Children offshore had  significantly higher rates of consultations with a mental health nurse  (z = -1.96; P = 0.002), psychologist (z = -2.32; P = 0.01) and counsellor  (z = -3.41; P < 0.001). As for reasons for presentation to general practitioners  and psychiatrists, complaints related to skin (z = -1.97; P = 0.05), respiratory  issues (z = -1.96; P = 0.05) and urological issues (z = -2.21; P = 0.03) were  significantly higher amongst children detained offshore. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to  children in the Australian community, children detained both onshore and offshore  had greater health needs. Children offshore also presented more frequently with a  range of complaints and accessed health services at higher rates than children  detained onshore; this adds to growing evidence about the harms of offshore  detention and detention more generally.",Jun-22,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,985-990,,6,58,,J Paediatr Child Health,,,,,,,,eng,"© 2022 The Authors.

Results of  studies have also shown a high prevalence (58-80%) of post-traumatic stress  disorder in war-affected children living in the occupied Palestinian territory.  The aim of this study was to estimate the direct and indirect effects of  perceived life satisfaction on the consequences of children's exposure to trauma  and the balance of positive and negative affect. METHODS: Palestinian children  were recruited from primary schools in four refugee camps in the Gaza Strip  (Bureij, Gaza Beach Camp, Jabalia, Rafah). All children had been involved in or  witnessed one or more episodes of violence involving other people in the 2 months  prior to the study (the 2012 Gaza War). We used the Multidimensional Students  Life Satisfaction Scale (peers, self, living environment, school, family), the  Positive and Negative Affect Scale for Children, and the revised Children Impact  of Events scale (intrusion and avoidance symptoms) to test (through structural  equation modelling) the moderation effect of life satisfaction on war trauma via  positive emotions. FINDINGS: 1276 Palestinian children were enrolled in this  study. The model tested with structural equation modelling was robust. Children's  life satisfaction influenced both the intrusion (β=-0·48; p=0.003) and avoidance  (β=-11; p=0·021) effects of primary traumatisation. The consequences of primary  traumatisation by intrusion (β=0·34; p=0·008) and avoidance (β=0·27; p=0.011)  contributed to increasing negative affect. Finally, perceived life satisfaction  had direct effects on affective experience, specifically increasing positive  affect and diminishing negative affect. INTERPRETATION: Perceived quality of life  in children has a role in controlling war-related traumas. Life satisfaction  contributes both directly and indirectly to change affectivity. When children  perceive themselves to be highly satisfied with their home and school  environment, living conditions, and relationships with peers and parents, the  effects of trauma are less severe.

Several factors come  into play, and each requires the nurturing care of caregivers. Although the  importance of ECD is well understood, the implementation of ECD programs is  scarce, especially in poor and vulnerable communities. OBJECTIVE: To improve  parents' wellbeing, parenting stress levels, parenting behavior, and discipline  strategies after the implementation of a newly designed parenting intervention.  PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Parents from Syria (125 mothers and fathers) in three  refugee camps in Lebanon and Jordan. METHODS: This was a pilot cohort study in  which parents' wellbeing, parenting stress levels, parenting behavior, and  discipline strategies were evaluated before and after participating in training  in the form of interactive and educational sessions to ameliorate their relations  and interactions with their children. RESULTS: By the end of this study, parents'  mental health and wellbeing improved (p < 0.001, Cohen's d: 0.61) and their  parenting index score was reduced (p < 0.001, Cohen's d: 1.24). Some of their  dysfunctional interactions with their children as well as the perceived  difficulties and conduct problems in their children aged 3 to 6 years were also  reduced significantly. CONCLUSION: The intervention used in this study succeeded  in improving some aspects of parenting practices and disciplines and in improving  the parents' wellbeing; however, more research is needed to assess its long-term  effects on parents and their children.

While significant evidence exists that early intervention is critical for  children exposed to adversities, few models have been established for addressing  the complex medical, psychological, and social needs of these patients in a  holistic manner. METHOD: La Linterna is an interdisciplinary clinical initiative  providing trauma-informed primary care, mental health treatment, immigration  legal counsel, and comprehensive case management to children (and their families)  exposed to adversities throughout the migration process. Started in 2019, the  clinic serves immigrant families throughout the city of Los Angeles. Described as  the process of implementing an interdisciplinary, trauma-informed practice to  meet the medical, mental health, social care needs of this uniquely vulnerable  patient population.

In both instances, the decision to leave is  usually cast by the family, and the life of CYAs is suddenly disrupted by  external circumstances. STUDY DESIGN: An anonymous survey. METHODS: The same  survey instrument, provided by the National Child Traumatic Stress Network  (NCTSN), was used to survey self-reported health needs among CYAs during the  aftermath of Hurricane Katrina (Health Survey for Children and Adolescents After  Katrina) in October 2005-February 2006 and again during the peak of refugee  arrivals in Berlin between October 2015 and March 2016. A weighted index to  measure cumulative exposure to traumatic stresses during migration was developed  along with an unweighted psychological impact score based on the 22-item NCTS  psychological impact questionnaire. Spearman's correlation coefficient (rho) was  used to assess the correlation between age and the two psychological impact  indices. The two-tailed t-test was used to investigate differences in trauma  experienced and psychological impact by gender. Logistic regression was used to  investigate differences in types of traumatic stress experienced and  psychological impact among CYAs displaced because of Hurricane Katrina and those  seeking asylum in Berlin. RESULTS: The Katrina cohort included a total of 1133  CYAs, the Berlin cohort, a total of 405 CYAs. The median age in the Katrina  cohort was 6.73 years (standard deviation [SD] 5.67, range 0-24; 50.13% males)  compared with 17.64 years (SD, range 0-24; 83% males) in the Berlin cohort.  Comparative analyses were adjusted to age and gender and revealed significant  differences between the two cohorts, both with regards to the amount of trauma  experienced and the psychological impact. A statistically significant and  moderate positive correlation was observed between trauma experienced and  psychological impact of migration in the refugee population (rho = 0.4955,  P < 0.001); the correlation was less pronounced but still significant in the  Katrina cohort (rho = 0.0942, P = 0.0015). Free-text responses revealed that in  addition to common concerns about health, housing and safety, refugees were also  pre-occupied with language acquisition and the adaptation to a new culture.  CONCLUSIONS: The observed differences in the experience and the consequences of  trauma in displaced CYAs warrant additional investigation. It was replicated that  human-made disaster seems to show more traumatising potential than natural  disaster.

DESIGN: A socioecological model of resilience,  community-based participatory research methods and two rounds of psychometric  testing created the Child Resilience Questionnaire (parent/caregiver report,  child report, school report). The parent/caregiver report (CRQ-P/C) is the focus  of this paper. SETTING: Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Culturally and socially diverse  parents/caregivers of children aged 5-12 years completed the CRQ-P/C in the pilot  (n=489) and validation study (n=1114). Recruitment via a large tertiary  hospital's outpatient clinics, Aboriginal and refugee background communities  (Aboriginal and bicultural researchers networks) and nested follow-up of mothers  in a pregnancy cohort and a cohort of Aboriginal families. ANALYSIS: Exploratory  and confirmatory factor analyses conducted to assess the structure and construct  validity of CRQ-P/C subscales. Cronbach's alpha used to assess internal  consistency of subscales. Criterion validity assessed with the Strengths and  Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) parent report. RESULTS: Conceptually developed  CRQ comprised 169 items in 19 subscales across five socioecological domains  (self, family, friends, school and community). Two rounds of psychometric  revision and community consultations created a CRQ-P/C with 43 items in 11  scales: self (positive self, positive future, managing emotions), family  (connectedness, guidance, basic needs), school (teacher support, engagement,  friends) and culture (connectedness, language). Excellent scale reliability  (α=0.7-0.9), except basic needs scale (α=0.61) (where a highly endorsed item was  retained for conceptual integrity). Criterion validity was supported: scales had  low to moderate negative correlations with SDQ total difficulty score (R(s=)  -0.2/-0.5. p<0.001); children with emotion/behavioural difficulties had lower  CRQ-P/C scores (β=-14.5, 95% CI -17.5 to -11.6, adjusted for gender). CONCLUSION:  The CRQ-P/C is a new multidomain measure of factors supporting resilience in  children. It has good psychometric properties and will have broad applications in  clinical, educational and research settings.

A cohort study of 12 474 persons  who died by suicide between 2006 and 2016.,Epidemiology and psychiatric sciences,,2045-7979 2045-7960,10.1017/S2045796022000397,,"AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine possible differences in psychiatric care contact and the type of contact in the year prior to suicide by migrant  status and region of origin compared to Swedish persons. METHODS: A  population-based open cohort design, using linked national registers, to study  all individuals aged 20-64 years who died by suicide between 1 January 2006 and  31 December 2016 in Sweden (N = 12 474). The primary exposure was migrant status  compared to the Swedish majority population in the following categories:  non-refugee migrants, refugee migrants and children of migrants. The secondary  exposure was region of origin in seven regions: Sweden, other Nordic countries,  Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, Asia, the Americas  and Oceania. The four outcomes were psychiatric in- and outpatient care,  prescribed and purchased psychotropic medication and a variable composing the  other variables, all measured the year before death. Logistic regression models  adjusted for age, sex, income and marital status estimated the likelihood of  psychiatric care utilisation by type of care within the year prior to death by  migrant status and region of origin (individually and combined). RESULTS: Out of  all who had died by suicide, 81% had had psychiatric care of any type in the year  before death by suicide. Among refugees the prevalence of psychiatric care before  death by suicide was 88%. Compared with the Swedish reference group, non-refugees  and persons from Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa had a lower likelihood of utilising  psychiatric care prior to suicide driven by a lower use of prescribed  psychotropic medication. Persons from the Middle East and North Africa had a  higher likelihood, driven by higher use of psychiatric outpatient care and  prescribed psychotropic medication. Non-refugees' likelihood of utilising care  before death by suicide was lower within the first 5 years of living in Sweden.  CONCLUSION: A large share of those who die by suicide use psychiatric care the  year before they die. Non-refugee migrants and persons from Asia and Sub-Saharan  Africa have a lower likelihood of utilising psychiatric care prior to suicide  compared to Swedish, whereas persons from the Middle East and North Africa have a  higher likelihood. Health care and policy makers should consider both migrant  status, region of origin and time in the new country for further suicide  prevention efforts.",2022-07-27,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,e56,,,31,,Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 35894222  PMCID: PMC9354119,,,,Humans; Child; Sweden/epidemiology; Cohort Studies; Epidemiology; *Refugees/psychology; *Transients and Migrants; psychiatric services; *Suicide; suicide; minority issues and cross-cultural psychiatry; Psychotropic Drugs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, the effects of  armed conflict on family processes such as parenting behavior, and subsequent  impacts on child psychosocial outcomes, are less understood. METHODS: This study  tests a conceptual model linking past war trauma and current displacement-related  stressors to maternal mental health, parenting behavior, and child psychosocial  problems. Cross-sectional data were collected in 2016-2017 from a sample of 291  Syrian refugee mothers in Lebanon. We used structural equation modeling to  examine associations between war trauma, daily stressors, mothers' general  psychological distress and post-traumatic stress (PTS), negative parenting, and  child psychosocial problems. RESULTS: Exposure to war-related events was directly  associated with maternal PTS and general psychological distress, as well as  indirectly via daily stressors. Mothers' general psychological distress, but not  PTS, was directly associated with negative parenting and child psychosocial  difficulties. Negative parenting mediated the association between maternal  general psychological distress and child psychosocial problems. Model fit  statistics indicate that the measurement and structural models provided a good  fit to the data. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the adverse effects of past  war trauma and ongoing displacement on refugee mothers' general mental health can  increase the risk of negative parenting behavior, and in turn contribute to  poorer psychosocial outcomes for children. Interventions should focus on  psychosocial and parenting support for war-affected caregivers, as well as  address structural challenges that debilitate caregiver and child mental health.",2018,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,e40,,,5,,Glob Ment Health (Camb),,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 30637113  PMCID: PMC6315283,,,,mental health; war; structural equation modeling; Displacement; parenting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tested whether the EmpaTeach  intervention could reduce physical violence from teachers to students in  Nyarugusu Refugee Camp, Tanzania. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a 2-arm  cluster-randomised controlled trial with parallel assignment. A complete sample  of all 27 primary and secondary schools in Nyarugusu Refugee Camp were approached  and agreed to participate in the study. Eligible students and teachers  participated in cross-sectional baseline, midline, and endline surveys in  November/December 2018, May/June 2019, and January/February 2020, respectively.  Fourteen schools were randomly assigned to receive a violence prevention  intervention targeted at teachers implemented in January-March 2019; 13 formed a  wait-list control group. The EmpaTeach intervention used empathy-building  exercises and group work to equip teachers with self-regulation, alternative  discipline techniques, and classroom management strategies. Allocation was not  concealed due to the nature of the intervention. The primary outcome was  students' self-reported experience of physical violence from teachers, assessed  at midline using a modified version of the ISPCAN Child Abuse Screening  Tool-Child Institutional. Secondary outcomes included student reports of  emotional violence, depressive symptoms, and school attendance. Analyses were by  intention to treat, using generalised estimating equations adjusted for  stratification factors. No schools left the study. In total, 1,493 of the 1,866  (80%) randomly sampled students approached for participation took part in the  baseline survey; at baseline 54.1% of students reported past-week physical  violence from school staff. In total, 1,619 of 1,978 students (81.9%) took part  in the midline survey, and 1,617 of 2,032 students (79.6%) participated at  endline. Prevalence of past-week violence at midline was not statistically  different in intervention (408 of 839 students, 48.6%) and control schools (412  of 777 students, 53.0%; risk ratio = 0.91, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.02, p = 0.106). No  effect was detected on secondary outcomes. A camp-wide educational policy change  during intervention implementation resulted in 14.7% of teachers in the  intervention arm receiving a compressed version of the intervention, but  exploratory analyses showed no difference in our primary outcome by school-level  adherence to the intervention. Main study limitations included the small number  of schools in the camp, which limited statistical power to detect small  differences between intervention and control groups. We also did not assess the  test-retest reliability of our outcome measures, and interviewers were unmasked  to intervention allocation. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence that the EmpaTeach  intervention effectively reduced physical violence from teachers towards primary  or secondary school students in Nyarugusu Refugee Camp. Further research is  needed to develop and test interventions to prevent teacher violence in  humanitarian settings.

This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of CAM use among a  sample of Palestinian children, investigate the factors that affect the use of  CAMs, identify the types of CAM used, and assess the purposes of using them.  METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study of parents who had children aged 6  years and below was carried out. A convenient sample of about 420 participants  was collected; from Primary care to Motherhood and Childhood Centers in Nablus  city in Palestine. Parents who agreed to participate were asked to answer a  survey that consists mainly of closed-ended questions. The analysis was performed  using SPSS version 16.0. RESULTS: The use of CAM was detected in all interviewers  420 (100%). The most common treatment used was herbal therapy (n = 400, 95.2%),  and anise was the most common herbal therapy used (n = 334; 79.5%). A total of  371 (88.3%) of the respondents used CAM for digestive system problems. The main  reason for using CAM was making the child more comfortable (n = 365; 86.9%).  Parents who are 30 years or older were significantly using more CAM than younger  parents (P = 0.001). In addition, regarding the number of children in the family,  parents who have five children or more used more CAM subtypes significantly more  than parents with less than this number (P = 0.025). Moreover, parents living in  a refugee camp used more CAM than parents who lived in urban or rural areas  (P = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS: Parents of children use CAM frequently. All parents  used CAM, and physicians were not mainly among the sources of CAM information,  and almost all parents were unaware of the side effects of CAM.

METHODS: We  conducted a retrospective clinical audit of all children and adolescents aged <18  years diagnosed with latent TBI at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne,  between 2010 and 2016 inclusive. The primary outcome was treatment completion,  defined as completing TPT to within one month of a target duration for the  specified regimen (for instance, at least five months of a six-month isoniazid  course), confirmed by the treating clinician.

It is  unknown whether these immigrants maintain their cultural norms of low  contraceptive use and high fertility when they live in settings with different  norms. METHODS: In 2016, interviews were conducted in Minnesota with Somali  immigrants and refugees to explore couple communication and decision making  regarding child spacing. Nineteen married men and women aged 25-51 were  interviewed. After a coding scheme was developed, key themes were identified and  examined by participants' sex, number of children and age of arrival in the  United States. RESULTS: Most participants discussed child spacing with their  spouse and had positive or neutral experiences. Some participants, especially  those with multiple children, stated that living in their new country had  influenced their fertility desires. Only those who had arrived after the age of  20 mentioned that experiencing closely spaced births had motivated them to  discuss child spacing. Participants emphasized the importance of information  sharing, compromise and joint decision making with their spouse. Priority for  child-spacing decision making was granted to women, largely because of their  primary role in childbirth. Men who had arrived in the United States before  turning 20 were more definitive about giving women decision-making priority.

To address this gap, this study reports a nationally representative  population-based study of refugees to determine the prevalence of probable  prolonged grief disorder (PGD) and its associated problems. METHODS: This study  recruited participants from the Building a New Life in Australia (BNLA)  prospective cohort study of refugees admitted to Australia between October 2013  and February 2014. The current data were collected in 2015-2016, and comprised  1767 adults, as well as 411 children of the adult respondents. Adult refugees  were assessed for trauma history, post-migration difficulties, probable PGD,  post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mental illness. Children were  administered the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. RESULTS: In this  cohort, 38.1% of refugees reported bereavement, of whom 15.8% reported probable  PGD; this represents 6.0% of the entire cohort. Probable PGD was associated with  a greater likelihood of mental illness, probable PTSD, severe mental illness,  currently unemployed and reported disability. Children of refugees with probable  PGD reported more psychological difficulties than those whose parents did not  have probable PGD. Probable PGD was also associated with the history of  imprisonment, torture and separation from family. Only 56.3% of refugees with  probable PGD had received psychological assistance. CONCLUSIONS: Bereavement and  probable PGD appear highly prevalent in refugees, and PGD seems to be associated  with disability in the refugees and psychological problems in their children.

This review describes pneumonia morbidity and mortality among children and  adolescents affected by humanitarian emergencies. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE,  EMBASE, and PubMed databases for publications reporting pneumonia morbidity or  mortality among children aged 1 month to 17 years in humanitarian emergencies  (eg, natural disaster, armed conflict, displacement) in low- and middle-income  countries (LMICs). RESULTS: We included 22 papers published between January 2000  and July 2021 from 33 countries, involving refugee/displaced persons camps  (n = 5), other conflict settings (n = 14), and natural disaster (n = 3).  Population pneumonia incidence was high for children under 5 years of age (73 to  146 episodes per 100 patient-years); 6%-29% met World Health Organization (WHO)  criteria for severe pneumonia requiring admission. Pneumonia accounted for  13%-34% of child and adolescent presentations to camp health facilities, 7%-48%  of presentations and admissions to health facilities in other conflict settings,  and 12%-22% of admissions to hospitals following natural disasters. Pneumonia  related deaths accounted for 7%-30% of child and adolescent deaths in hospital,  though case-fatality rates varied greatly (0.5%-17.2%). The risk for pneumonia  was greater for children who are: recently displaced, living in crowded settings  (particularly large camps), with deficient water and sanitation facilities, and  those who are malnourished.

While risk does occur at individual  level, it is determined by aspirations which are connected to others and society.  For many displaced women globally, these aspirations are often linked to the  well-being of their children and other household members. This article explores  the links between aspirations for the future, gendered household dynamics, and  health risk-taking behavior among the Rwandan urban refugee community. METHODS:  This analysis drew from participant observation, focus group discussions, and  in-depth interviews with 49 male and 42 female household members from 36 Rwandan  refugee households in Yaoundé, Cameroon. The fieldwork was conducted over  12 months between May-August 2016, May-August 2017, and February-August 2018.  RESULTS: We observed that while there was considerable convergence among  household members in aspirations, there was considerable difference in  risk-taking practices engaged to achieve them with women often assuming the  greatest risks. These gendered realities of risk were not only related to  structural concerns including access to different forms of capital, but also to  socio-cultural gendered expectations of women, how risks were defined and  justified, and household dynamics that drove the gendered reality of observed  risk-behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Humanitarian programs and policies are distinctly  finite in nature; focused on the short-term needs of persons affected by  conflict. However, many humanitarian situations in the world are protracted. In  the midst of these challenges, themes of future-orientation, possibilities, and  shared aspirations for a better future emerge. These aspirations and the  practices, including risk-taking practices that stem from them are central to  understand if we are to ensure a just peace and stability in displaced  communities throughout the developing world. Our analysis highlights the need to  examine sociocultural dimensions related to hopes for the future, gender, and  household dynamics as a way to understand risk behavior. We propose this can be  done through a framework of precarious hope which we put forward in this paper,  in which hope, agency, sociocultural and political economic contexts situate risk  as a gendered practice of hope amidst constraint.",2019,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,18,,,13,,Confl Health,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 31139249  PMCID: PMC6530091,,,,Refugees; Risk; Gender; Cameroon; Health behavior; Non-compliance; Sex work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A  systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Relevant studies  published from 2000 to 2020 were identified through a systematic search of six  electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, RISS, KMBASE). A  meta-analysis of the studies was then undertaken.

Although many studies have examined mental health concerns  in this population, few studies have assessed sleep or examined the relationship  between sleep and mental health or psychosocial functioning. OBJECTIVES: The  objectives were to (1) examine the prevalence of sleep disturbance within  refugees and asylum seekers from diverse backgrounds, (2) examine mental health  and psychosocial factors associated with sleep disturbance, and (3) explore  whether symptoms cluster together in unique subsets of individuals. METHODS:  Clinician-administered interview data (N = 2703) were obtained from a large  mental health service in greater Melbourne, Australia. Data included patient  demographics, sleep disturbance, mental health (anxiety, depression, traumatic  stress symptoms), and psychosocial concerns (family dysfunctions, interpersonal  difficulties, social isolation). RESULTS: A total of 75.5% of the sample reported  moderate or severe sleep disturbance. Severity of sleep disturbance was  positively correlated with severity of mental health symptoms, psychosocial  concerns, age, and migration status. This was true in both refugee and asylum  seeker populations and in both adults and children.

By neglecting the needs of refugees, interventions may fail to  capture the complex patterns of refugees' daily lives within camps. This paper  provides a comprehensive assessment of the needs of encamped Malian refugees in  Northern Burkina Faso following the 2012-armed conflict. In addition to assessing  the needs of Malian refugees, the study aimed to critically assess from an  upstream perspective the degree of their involvement in policies and practices  that are targeted towards improving their livelihood. METHODS: We took an  ""upstream"" view on the lives of Malian refugees to identify their unmet needs. A  purposive sampling strategy was employed to collect data from various media  sources, including data aggregated from the website of the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The most populous refugee camp (Mentao) was  visited in September 2012 and in-depth group discussion and interviews were  conducted with key informants, including nine camp representatives and four  officials from the central and decentralized administrations. RESULTS: Media  canvass combined with the UNHCR level 2 census revealed a flawed headcount of  refugees, which was 205.4% higher than the real number in Burkina Faso. Although  refugees live harmoniously with the natives and their security has been assured,  they strongly complained about the number of unused food items distributed. Camps  were distributed among humanitarian organizations leading to differential  advantage and resources from one camp to another. Additionally, idleness, lack of  classrooms facilities for pre-school children and lack of continuous healthcare  services were major concerns raised. Further, refugees expressed limited  involvement in the planning and implementation of programs that are related to  their welfare. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that refugees' voices were not  taken into consideration in making tailor-made programs. This calls for more  comprehensive surge capacity to deal with refugees' basic needs. Further, a  strong leadership from hoststate should be encouraged to offer equal  opportunities to refugees regardless of their camps.

Forms of cognitive-behavioural therapy are the  most commonly used treatment for PTSD, but evidence from sophisticated studies in  clinical settings among children is limited. Method: This multicentre, parallel,  non-blinded, pragmatic randomized controlled trial assessed the effectiveness of  narrative exposure therapy (NET) in traumatized children and adolescents. Fifty  9-17-year-old participants, who had experienced prolonged traumatic conditions in  the form of refugeedom or family violence and suffered from PTSD symptoms, were  randomized into NET (n = 29) and treatment as usual (TAU; n = 21) active control  groups. The objective was to determine whether NET can be feasibly implemented  within the existing healthcare system of a high-income country and whether it  would reduce mental health problems, especially PTSD, and increase resilience, in  children and adolescents with multiple traumas more effectively than TAU. We  hypothesized that NET would be more effective than TAU in reducing symptoms and  increasing resilience. Results: Analysis of variance revealed that PTSD and  psychological distress, but not depression symptoms, decreased regardless of  treatment group. Resilience increased in both groups. Within-group analyses  showed that the decrease in PTSD symptoms was significant in the NET group only.  The effect sizes were large in NET but small in TAU. Concerning PTSD symptom  cut-off scores, the reduction in the share of participants with clinical-level  PTSD was significant in the NET group only. Intention-to-treat analyses using  linear mixed models confirmed these results. Conclusions: Despite its  shortcomings, this study gives preliminary support for the safety, effectiveness,  and usefulness of NET among multiply traumatized children and adolescents in  clinical settings.

In 2016, the district-based immunization  coverage evaluation survey (CES) assessed routine immunization coverage at the  district level in Lebanon among children aged 12-59 months. METHODS: A  cross-sectional multistage cluster survey was conducted in all of Lebanon (with  the exception of the Nabatieh district) using the World Health Organization (WHO)  recommended Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) methodology adapted to the  local context. A survey questionnaire consisting of closed and open-ended  questions concerning demographic information and the child's immunization status  was administered to collect immunization status information. RESULTS: Among  surveyed children aged 12-59 months, irrespective of nationality, vaccination  coverage at the national level for any recommended last dose was below the  targeted 95%. Generally, vaccination coverage levels increased with age and were  higher among Lebanese than Syrian children. However, large variations were  revealed when coverage rates were analyzed at the district level. Vaccination was  significantly associated with nationality, age, mother's educational status and  the place of vaccination. Common reasons for undervaccination included the  child's illness at the time of vaccine administration, vaccination fees, lack of  awareness or a doctor's advice not to vaccinate during campaigns. CONCLUSIONS:  Substantial variability exists in vaccination coverage among children aged  12-59 months residing in different districts in Lebanon. Immunization coverage  reached 90% or above only for the first doses of polio and pentavalent vaccines.  A considerable dropout rate from the first dose of any vaccine is observed.  Efforts to optimize coverage levels should include increased vaccination  initiatives targeting both refugee children and children from vulnerable host  communities, increased cooperation between public and private vaccine providers,  improved training for vaccine providers to adhere to complete vaccine  administration recommendations, and increased awareness among caregivers.",2019-01-14,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,58,,1,19,,BMC Public Health,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 30642314  PMCID: PMC6332691,,,,"Humans; Female; Cross-Sectional Studies; Male; Surveys and Questionnaires; Ethnicity; Child, Preschool; Infant; *Refugees; Syria; Syrian refugees; Caregivers; Lebanon; *Armed Conflicts; Immunization Programs; Poliovirus Vaccines/administration & dosage; Vaccination/*statistics & numerical data; Vaccination coverage; *Immunization; *Vaccination Coverage; Coverage evaluation survey; Expanded Programme on immunization; Patient Dropouts; Poliomyelitis; Rotavirus Vaccines/administration & dosage; Vaccines, Attenuated/administration & dosage; Vaccines/*administration & dosage",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We undertook  a comprehensive case finding and TB preventive treatment (TPT) program in 7  schools in the Zero TB Kids project. We aimed to measure the TB infection and  disease burden and investigate the risk of TB disease in children and adults who  did and did not receive TPT in the schools. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A mobile team  annually screened children and staff for TB at the 7 boarding schools in Himachal  Pradesh, India, using symptom criteria, radiography, molecular diagnostics, and  tuberculin skin tests. TB infection (TBI) was treated with short-course regimens  of isoniazid and rifampin or rifampin. TB disease was treated according to  Tibetan and Indian guidelines. Between April 2017 and December 2019, 6,582  schoolchildren (median age 14 [IQR 11-16] years) and 807 staff (median age 40  [IQR 33-48] years) were enrolled. Fifty-one percent of the students and 58% of  the staff were females. Over 13,161 person-years of follow-up in schoolchildren  (median follow-up 2.3 years) and 1,800 person-years of follow-up in staff (median  follow-up 2.5 years), 69 TB episodes occurred in schoolchildren and 4 TB episodes  occurred in staff, yielding annual incidence rates of 524/100,000 (95% CI  414-663/100,000) person-years and 256/100,000 (95% CI 96-683/100,000)  person-years, respectively. Of 1,412 schoolchildren diagnosed with TBI, 1,192  received TPT. Schoolchildren who received TPT had 79% lower risk of TB disease  (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.21; 95% CI 0.07-0.69; p = 0.010) compared to  non-recipients, the primary study outcome. Protection was greater in recent  contacts (aHR 0.07; 95% CI 0.01-0.42; p = 0.004), the secondary study outcome.  The prevalence of recent contacts was 28% (1,843/6,582). Two different TPT  regimens were used (3HR and 4R), and both were apparently effective. No staff  receiving TPT developed TB. Overall, between 2017 and 2019, TB disease incidence  decreased by 87%, from 837/100,000 (95% CI 604-1,129/100,000) person-years to  110/100,000 (95% CI 36-255/100,000) person-years (p < 0.001), and TBI prevalence  decreased by 42% from 19% (95% CI 18%-20%) to 11% (95% CI 10%-12%) (p < 0.001). A  limitation of our study is that TB incidence could be influenced by secular  trends during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, following  implementation of a school-wide TB screening and preventive treatment program, we  observed a significant reduction in the burden of TB disease and TBI in children  and adolescents. The benefit of TPT was particularly marked for recent TB  contacts.

Data on the health care  provision to asylum-seeking children in European contexts is scarce. In this  study we compare the health care provided to recent asylum-seeking and  non-asylum-seeking children at a Swiss tertiary hospital. METHODS: We performed a  cross-sectional retrospective study in a pediatric tertiary care hospital in  Basel, Switzerland. All patients and visits from January 2016 to December 2017  were identified, using administrative and medical electronic health records. The  asylum-seeking status was systematically assessed and the patients were allocated  accordingly in the two study groups. RESULTS: A total of 202,316 visits by 55,789  patients were included, of which asylum-seeking patients accounted for 1674 (1%)  visits by 439 (1%) individuals. The emergency department recorded the highest  number of visits in both groups with a lower proportion in asylum-seeking  compared to non-asylum-seeking children: 19% (317/1674) and 32% (64,315/200,642)  respectively. The median number of visits per patient was 1 (IQR 1-2) in the  asylum-seeking and 2 (IQR 1-4) in the non-asylum-seeking children. Hospital  admissions were more common in asylum-seeking compared to non-asylum-seeking  patients with 11% (184/1674) and 7% (14,692/200,642). Frequent visits (> 15  visits per patient) accounted for 48% (807/1674) of total visits in  asylum-seeking and 25% (49,886/200,642) of total visits in non-asylum-seeking  patients. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital visits by asylum-seeking children represented a  small proportion of all visits. The emergency department had the highest number  of visits in all patients but was less frequently used by asylum-seeking  children. Frequent care suggests that asylum-seeking patients also present with  more complex diseases.

The disease is associated with recurrent episodes of  abdominal pain and pancreatitis, eruptive cutaneous xanthomatosis, lipemia  retinalis, and hepatosplenomegaly. A consanguineous Syrian family who migrated to  Lebanon was referred to our laboratory after perceiving familial chylomicronemia  syndrome in two children. The LPL and PCSK9 genes were sequenced and plasma PCSK9  levels were measured. Sanger sequencing of the LPL gene revealed the presence of  the p.(Val227Phe) pathogenic variant in exon 5 at the homozygous state in the two  affected children, and at the heterozygous state in the other recruited family  members. Interestingly, PCSK9 levels in homozygous carriers of the p.(Val227Phe)  were ≈50% lower than those in heterozygous carriers of the variant (p-value =  0.13) and ranged between the 5th and the 7.5th percentile of PCSK9 levels in a  sample of Lebanese children of approximately the same age group. Moreover, this  is the first reported case of individuals carrying simultaneously an LPL  pathogenic variant and PCSK9 variants, the L10 and L11 leucine insertion, which  can lower and raise low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels  respectively. TG levels fluctuated concomitantly between the two children, were  especially high following the migration from a country to another, and were  reduced under a low-fat diet. This case is crucial to raise public awareness on  the risks of consanguineous marriages to decrease the emergence of inherited  autosomal recessive diseases. It also highlights the importance of the early  diagnosis and management of these diseases to prevent serious complications, such  as recurrent pancreatitis in the case of familial hyperchylomicronemia.",2022,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,961028,,,13,,Front Genet,,,,,,,,eng,"Copyright © 2022 Ayoub, Azar, Maddah, Ghaleb, Elbitar, Abou-Khalil, Jambart, Varret, Boileau, El Khoury and Abifadel.",,,,,,Place: Switzerland PMID: 36061186  PMCID: PMC9437297,,,,Syria; Lebanon; chylomicronemia syndrome; LPL gene; PCSK9 levels; triglycerides; type 1 hyperlipoproteinemia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since 2011,  we have tested children <2 years old with Quantiferon-TB Gold/Gold Plus (QFT)) in  select clinical scenarios at Denver Health, a health system encompassing a TB  clinic, refugee and immigrant screening and primary care. METHODS: We identified  patients <2 years old tested with QFT between February, 2011 and August, 2019.  The primary outcome measure was incident cases of TB among tested patients. Test  results and in vitro characteristics were analyzed, as were demographic,  epidemiologic and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: We analyzed 116 QFTs ordered in  children age 7-23 months. Two were positive, 3 indeterminate, 3 failed/refused  phlebotomy and the remainder (93%) were negative. Mitogen tube results were  robust. Thirteen patients were TST-positive: 11 were QFT-negative, 1 QFT-positive  and 1 failed phlebotomy. Eight patients received some form of TB medication,  including 4 QFT-negative patients who were treated for active TB or latent TB  infection based on positive TST or clinical findings. Among QFT-negative  patients, including 6 TST-positive, not treated for active TB or latent TB  infection, no TB disease has been identified over a median follow-up time of 2.96  years. CONCLUSIONS: IGRA use was not limited by barriers of phlebotomy,  indeterminate result or gamma-interferon production. The risk of missing an  infected but IGRA-negative patient can be reduced by treatment of select patients  at higher risk.

Australian clinicians will report  results from detailed health and well-being assessments of asylum seeking  children and adolescents who have experienced prolonged immigration detention.  METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a national, multicentre study with a longitudinal  cohort design that will document health and well-being outcomes of the children  and adolescents who have been detained in offshore detention on the remote island  of Nauru. Outcome measures will be reported from the time arrival in Australia  and repeated over a 5-year follow-up period. Measures include demographics,  residency history and refugee status, physical health and well-being outcomes  (including mental health, development and social-emotional well-being), clinical  service utilisation and psychosocial risk and protective factors for health and  well-being (eg, adverse childhood experiences). Longitudinal follow-up will  capture outcomes over a 5-year period after arrival in Australia. Analysis will  be undertaken to explore baseline risk and protective factors, with regression  analyses to assess their impact on health and well-being outcomes. To understand  how children's outcomes change over time, multilevel regression analysis will be  utilised. Structural equation modelling will be conducted to explore the  correlation between baseline factors, mediational factors and outcomes to assess  trajectories over time.

Exposure to war, living in conflict zones, and forced displacement increase the  risk of experiencing a broad spectrum of direct and indirect burdens towards  physical and mental health, in particular among children. Objective: This letter  to the editor aims to provide multiple clinical and 'mental health and  psychosocial support' (MHPSS) systems' perspectives by experts working in ongoing  aid efforts to bridge and disseminate their current observations towards child  and adolescent mental health services involved in the mental health response to  the current war in Ukraine. Results and Discussion: The diverse perspectives from  three mental health professionals involved in the MHPSS response highlight the  different burdens and needs of children being confronted with situations of an  existential nature. Children live through transformed social situations,  deteriorated life conditions, general uncertainty, and encounter numerous losses.  As such, war is the ultimate non-normative and existential stressor. The four  perspectives highlight the need to: (1) adjust help toward the needs of the  beneficiary, (2) understand help efforts as intersubjective human encounters and  enable parents and caregivers in these encounters, (3) recognise losses and  embrace finding ways to facilitate grief, and (4) continue to address these needs  in a coordinated way that follows inter-agency guidelines. Conclusion: Better  understanding the needs of refugee children underlines the importance of  investing in their future by providing resources for humanitarian aid and  psychosocial interventions during sustained emergencies. The perspectives  presented in this letter emphasise that psychosocial care is deeply rooted in  intersubjective help-encounters and, therefore, a professionalisation of  interventions should co-occur with their humanisation and be adapted to  subjective needs, varying sociocultural backgrounds, and the individuals  themselves with the goal of reducing suffering and fostering well-being.  HIGHLIGHTS: The three expert humanitarian aid perspectives highlight the need to:  adjust help toward the needs of the beneficiary,understand help efforts as  intersubjective human encounters and enable parents and caregivers in these  encounters,recognise losses and embrace finding ways to facilitate grief,  andcontinue to address these needs in a coordinated way that follows inter-agency  guidelines.",2022,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,2101759,,2,13,,Eur J Psychotraumatol,,,,,,,,eng,"© 2022 The Author(s).

The present study  aimed to measure the prevalence and sociodemographic correlates of household FI  and to explore the association of household FI with anthropometric measures of  children and their mothers. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey (2014-2015). SETTING:  Lebanon.ParticipantsNationally representative sample of Lebanese households with  4-18-year-old-children and their mothers (n 1204). RESULTS: FI prevalence (95 %  CI), measured using the Arabic-translated, validated Household Food Insecurity  Access Scale, was found to be 49·3 (44·0, 54·6) % in the study sample. Mild,  moderate and severe FI were found in 7·0 (5·5, 9·2) %, 23·3 (20·1, 26·8) % and  18·9 (14·9, 23·5) % of households, respectively. Multiple regression analysis  showed that low maternal and paternal education, unemployment and crowding were  significant correlates of household FI (P&lt;0·05). No significant associations  were observed between FI and anthropometric measures of children and their  mothers, after adjusting for other socio-economic correlates. Food-insecure  households reported various mechanisms to cope with food shortage, such as  reducing the number of meals/d (49·6 %), borrowing food (54·4 %), spending  savings (34·5 %) and withdrawing children from schools (8·0 %). CONCLUSIONS: FI  exists among a remarkable proportion of Lebanese households with children.

Children aged 5-7 years  and their families (n = 150) from 6 racial/ethnic groups (n = 25 each Black,  Hispanic, Hmong, Native American, Somali, and White families) were recruited for  the Family Matters mixed-methods study in 2015 through primary care clinics in  Minneapolis and St Paul, MN.

TST-R provides trauma-focused mental health  treatment and addresses problems in part exacerbated by harsh U.S. immigration  policies (e.g., poor mental health, stigma, fear) that have implications for the  psychosocial well-being of immigrant children and families, especially those who  have experienced migration-related trauma. METHOD: Informed by a community-based  participatory research approach, TST-R was developed as an adaptation of trauma  systems therapy to address common barriers to care experienced by those of  refugee and immigrant backgrounds, including mental health stigma, distrust of  service systems, and cultural and linguistic barriers. RESULTS: TST-R is a  multitiered and phase-based intervention that strategically addresses stressors  and needs across levels of the social ecology. Most TST-R services are delivered  in easily accessible, nonstigmatizing settings (e.g., school) by a cultural  broker and a clinician who work in partnership. TST-R has been disseminated and  implemented with multiple cultural groups (e.g., Somali, Bhutanese) across the  United States and Canada. CONCLUSIONS: Given the unique stressors, strengths, and  needs of immigrant children and their families, mental health services must be  equitable, community based, and sustainable. TST-R demonstrates promise as a  prevention and intervention model especially for those experiencing immigration  policy-related stressors and may serve as a guide for developing child mental  health policies and immigration policies that promote mental well-being for  immigrant families.

We examined whether health system utilization,  costs, and aggregate 1-year morbidity differed by resettlement model. METHODS:  Population-based matched cohort study in Ontario, 2008 to 2018, including  pediatric (0-17 years) resettled refugees and matched Ontario-born peers and  categorized refugees by resettlement model: (1) private sponsorship (PSRs), (2)  Blended Visa Office-Referred program (BVORs), and (3) government-assisted refugee  (GAR). Primary outcomes were health system utilization and costs in year 1 in  Canada. Multivariable logistic regression was used to test the associations  between sponsorship model and major illnesses. RESULTS: We included 23 287  resettled refugees (13 360 GARs, 1544 BVORs, 8383 PSRs) and 93 148 matched  Ontario-born. Primary care visits were highest among GARs and lowest in PSRs  (median visits [interquartile range], GARs 4[2-6]; BVORs 3[2-5]; PSRs 3[2-5]; P  <.001).

Almost eradicated in high-income  countries (HIC), it persists in low- and middle-income countries. The purpose of  the study was to assess the feasibility and meaningfulness of ultrasound-based  RHD screening among the population of unaccompanied foreign minors in Italy and  determine the burden of asymptomatic RHD among this discrete population. METHODS:  From February 2016 to January 2018, Médecins Sans Frontières conducted a weekly  mobile screening by echocardiography in reception centers and family houses for  unaccompanied foreign minors in Rome, followed by fix echocardiographic retesting  for those resulting positive at screening. 'Definite' and 'borderline' cases were  defined according to the World Hearth Federation criteria. RESULTS: Six hundred  fifty-three individuals (13-26 years old) were screened; 95.6% were below  18 years old (624/653). Six 'definite RHD' were identified at screening, yielding  a detection rate of 9.2‰ (95% CI 4.1-20.3‰), while 285 (436.4‰) were defined as  'borderline' (95% CI 398.8-474.9‰). Out of 172 ""non-negative borderline"" cases  available for being retested (113 ""non-negative borderline"" lost in follow-up),  additional 11 were categorized as 'definite RHD', for a total of 17 'definite  RHD', yielding a final prevalence of 26.0‰ (95% CI 16.2-41.5‰) (17/653), and 122  (122/653) were confirmed as 'borderline' (final prevalence of 186.8‰, 95% CI  158.7-218.7). In multivariate logistic regression analysis the presence of  systolic murmur was a strong predictor for both 'borderline' (OR 4.3 [2.8-6.5])  and 'definite RHD' (OR 5.2 [1.7-15.2]), while no specific country/geographic area  of origin was statistically associated with an increased risk of latent,  asymptomatic RHD. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for RHD among the unaccompanied migrant  minors in Italy proved to be feasible. The burden of 'definite RHD' was similar  to that identified in resource-poor settings, while the prevalence of  'borderline' cases was higher than reported in other studies. In view of these  findings, the health system of high-income countries, hosting migrants and asylum  seekers, are urged to adopt screening for RHD in particular among the silent and  marginalized population of refugee and migrant children.",2019-04-02,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,12,,1,17,,Pediatr Rheumatol Online J,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 30940181  PMCID: PMC6444853,,,,Humans; Adult; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Retrospective Studies; Child; Adolescent; Young Adult; Feasibility Studies; Mass Screening/*methods; Echocardiography; Italy/epidemiology; Refugees/*statistics & numerical data; Transients and Migrants/*statistics & numerical data; ‘borderline Rheumatic Heart Disease’; ‘definite Rheumatic Heart Disease’; Echocardiography/*methods; Migrants health; Population screening; Rheumatic Heart Disease/*diagnosis/epidemiology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: Rapid search in the Medline data base, and  in relevant Ukrainian and international health data bases; narrative synthesis of  findings, followed by a prioritization of health problems and interventions by  two medical doctors, using the risk matrix approach. RESULTS: Immunization  coverage is low for Covid-19, resulting in outbreaks in refugee shelters. There  are vaccination gaps for measles and other basic immunizations, particularly in  older children; children aged 2-5 years have not received the second measles  dose.

We identified  sixty-nine distal determinants of adverse MHC beneath the proximal causes. Too  numerous and too diverse to treat effecvively with limited resources, these root  causes of MHC were thematically grouped into: laws and regulations, capacity and  resources, accountability and standards, prioritization, bias and stigma, and  displacement.

The harsh circumstances  experienced by refugees include various factors associated with respiratory  pathogen transmission, and clinical progression of CAP. Consequently, the  etiology of CAP in humanitarian crisis situations may differ to that of settled  populations, which would impact appropriate case management. Therefore, the  Pneumonia Etiology Among Refugees and the Lebanese population (PEARL) study was  initiated with the objective of identifying the causal pathogenic microorganisms  in the respiratory tract of children and adults from both the refugee and host  country population presenting with signs of CAP during a humanitarian crisis.

Sociodemographic and medical data, and biological samples will be collected from  at least 600 CAP cases and 600 controls. Nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, urine and  blood samples will be analyzed at five clinical pathology laboratories in Lebanon  to identify the bacterial and viral etiological agents of CAP. Transcriptomic  profiling of host leukocytes will be performed.

Contrary to what  is envisioned, the ultimate reunification can be a challenging transition.  Reestablishing the parent-child relationship can be hindered by the anger,  distress, vulnerability, and abuse the child may have experienced during the  separation leading to behavioral concerns and depressive symptoms. The  culmination of trauma and adverse childhood events prior to and following  reunification is associated with an increased risk of anxiety, depression,  behavioral disorders, and toxic stress. Unaddressed, these issues can lead to  poor adult psychiatric health and limit a child's educational success and  potential lifetime earnings. Trauma-informed programming has been an effective  tool in addressing the mental health needs of refugee and immigrant children and  may benefit this particular group of reunified families when held in a community  setting alongside peer support. Familias Reunidas and Family Reunification and  Resiliency Training (FUERTE) are 2 community-based programs that successfully  guided recently reunified families through the process of reconnecting. Review of  these programs suggests there is significance in the collaboration of health care  providers, education specialists, and community liaisons in program creation,  cultivation of a supportive group environment, incorporation of trauma-informed  principles, and partnership with a community establishment. These components can  lead to a reunification program that provides access to mental health services in  order to work toward eliminating the health disparities affecting these families.  Brief Summary: Family reunification can be a challenging transition for recently  immigrated children whose parent(s) immigrated to the US years before them.

To date, dissemination of family planning research and  programmatic experience targeting young people in Jordan has been limited. AIMS:  This study aimed to provide in-depth information on family planning intervention  programmes, research and policies in Jordan that focus on young people aged 10-24  years. METHODS: Data were gathered through a systematic review of peer-reviewed  and grey literature related to reproductive health of young people, and focus  groups discussions with stakeholders from 18 relevant governmental and  nongovernmental organizations. RESULTS: The literature review included 37  documents produced since 2008, which provide information at the individual,  family/community, service delivery and policy levels. Young people in Jordan have  limited knowledge of family planning methods and where to obtain family planning  services. Little information is available on the availability of family planning  services for young people. Several policy documents discuss family planning and  reproductive health of young people in Jordan. Focus group discussions identified  opportunities to integrate services and strengthen the development of future  policies.

Healthcare facilities have been overburdened  during this period and the country witnessed outbreaks of many infectious  diseases. Thus, the evaluation of vaccine compliance for mandatory and  non-mandatory vaccines as well as the factors affecting the vaccination rate  among Lebanese residents and Syrian refugees is fundamental. BACKGROUND: Since  2012, Lebanon has hosted around 1.2 million Syrian refugees, a high number in a  country whose population does not exceed 4.4 million. Healthcare facilities have  been overburdened during this period, which has led to the spread of many  infectious diseases, including outbreaks of measles, mumps and hepatitis. At the  appearance of such outbreaks, it becomes essential to evaluate vaccine compliance  and the factors influencing the vaccination rate among Lebanese residents and  Syrian refugees in infants and children up to 15 y of age. METHODS: A total of  571 infants and children were recruited in Beirut and Mount Lebanon, two  governorates that together host half of the Lebanese population. RESULTS: A very  high rate of vaccine compliance was seen for mandatory vaccines, whereas an  intermediate to very low rate of compliance was found for non-mandatory vaccines.  Both bivariate and multiple regression analyses indicated that age group and  regular consultation of a pediatrician were independently associated with  immunization coverage. Bivariate analysis indicated that parental age,  occupational and educational status of parents, family size and vaccine price  were also independently associated with immunization coverage. Incomplete  vaccination coverage was associated with socioeconomic factors. CONCLUSIONS: From  these results, it becomes apparent that it may be necessary to reassess  vaccination priorities considering the current socioeconomic situation.",2019-11-13,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,568-579,,6,11,,Int Health,,,,,,,,eng,"© The Author(s) 2019.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We  retrospectively reviewed sociodemographic characteristics, laboratory parameters,  and clinical outcomes of pediatric patients that underwent cardiopulmonary  resuscitation due to prehospital cardiac arrest at two pediatric emergency  departments in Izmir Hospital of Health Sciences University and Gaziantep Cengiz  Gökçek Kadın Doğum ve Çocuk Hospital of Health Ministry between August 2017 and  August 2018. RESULTS: The present study included 188 patients (112 patients from  Gaziantep and 76 patients from Izmir). All patients arrived at the hospital  through emergency medical services. The median age was lower (14 days vs. 15  months; P < 0.001), and the proportion of Syrian refugees was higher in patients  from Gaziantep (78.6% vs. 7.9%; P < 0,001). In both centers, respiratory failure  was the most common etiology.

It remains a frequent reason for  infection-related admissions to emergency units among all age groups. Following  the Syrian refugee crisis and insufficient clean water in our region, we sought  to assess the etiological and epidemiological factors pertaining to AGE in South  Lebanon. METHODS: In this multi-center cross sectional clinical study, we  analyzed the demographic, clinical and laboratory data of 619 Lebanese children  from the age of 1 month to 5 years old who were admitted with AGE to pediatrics  departments of three tertiary care centers in South Lebanon. RESULTS: Our results  revealed that males had a higher incidence of AGE (57.3%) than females.  Enteropathogens were identified in 332/619 (53.6%) patients. Single pathogens  were found in 294/619 (47.5%) patients, distributed as follows: Entamoeba  histolytica in 172/619 (27.8%) patients, rotavirus in 84/619 (13.6%), and  adenovirus in 38/619 (6.1%). Mixed co-pathogens were identified in 38/619 (6.1%)  patients. Analyzing the clinical manifestations indicated that E. histolytica  caused the most severe AGE. In addition, children who received rotavirus vaccine  were significantly less prone to rotavirus infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings  alluded to the high prevalence of E. histolytica and other unidentified  enteropathogens as major potential causes of pediatric AGE in hospitalized  Lebanese children. This should drive us to widen our diagnostic panel by adopting  new diagnostic techniques other than the routinely used ones (particularly  specific for the pathogenic amoeba E. histolytica and for the unidentified  enteropathogens), and to improve health services in this unfortunate area of the  world where insanitary water supplies and lack of personal hygiene represent a  major problem.",2019-04-30,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,137,,1,19,,BMC Pediatr,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 31039787  PMCID: PMC6489254,,,,"Humans; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Female; Cross-Sectional Studies; Male; Infant, Newborn; Age Factors; Sex Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Logistic Models; Child, Preschool; Infant; Pediatric; Developing Countries; Acute Disease; Lebanon/epidemiology; Lebanon; Child, Hospitalized; *Seasons; Acute gastroenteritis; Antiviral Agents/*administration & dosage; E. histolytica; Gastroenteritis/diagnosis/drug therapy/*epidemiology/*virology; Rotavirus Infections/diagnosis/drug therapy/*epidemiology; Unidentified enteropathogens",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, children aged 6-23 are commonly vulnerable to poor complementary  feeding. Proper complementary feeding is of paramount importance to the healthy  growth and survival of a children. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the  level of appropriate complementary feeding practices and associated factors among  internally displaced children aged 6-23 months in northwest Ethiopia, 2020.  METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from June to July  2020 among 264 internally displaced mothers of children 6-23 months in northwest  Ethiopia. A systematic random sampling technique was used to reach the study  subjects and data were collected using a structured and pre-tested  interviewer-administered questionnaire.

Psychosomatic explanation invokes a social grey zone in which ambiguities and  conflicts about agency, causality and moral responsibility abound. This conflict  reflects the deep-seated dualism in Western ontology and concepts of personhood  that plays out in psychosomatic research, theory and practice. Illnesses that are  seen as psychologically mediated tend also to be viewed as less real or  legitimate. New forms of this dualism are evident in philosophical attacks on  Engel's biopsychosocial approach, which was a mainstay of earlier psychosomatic  theory, and in the recent Research Domain Criteria research programme of the US  National institute of Mental Health which opts for exclusively biological modes  of explanation of illness. We use the example of resignation syndrome among  refugee children in Sweden to show how efforts to account for such medically  unexplained symptoms raise problems of the ascription of agency. We argue for an  integrative multilevel approach that builds on recent work in embodied and  enactive cognitive science. On this view, agency can have many fine gradations  that emerge through looping effects that link neurophenomenology, narrative  practices and cultural affordances in particular social contexts. This multilevel  ecosocial view points the way towards a renewed biopsychosocial approach in  training and clinical practice that can advance person-centred medicine and  psychiatry.",Jun-19,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,169-182,,2,45,,Med Humanit,,,,,,,,eng,© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was carried out to gather  evidence, from a total of eight articles. Data analysis was conducted using the  Critical Appraisal Skills Programme check tool to systematically assess the  trustworthiness, relevance and results of the included papers.

Mothers with infants admitted to the  neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) face additional risk for PPD, coupled with  risk factors extending beyond a NICU admision. The novelty of this review is the  focus on maternal PPD for mothers with infants admitted to the NICU.  Interventions aimed at limiting and preventing PPD in this population include:  prenatal and postpartum depression screening, PPD symptom awareness and  monitoring, and trauma-informed care. RECENT FINDINGS: PPD, the most frequent  complication of childbirth, affects approximately 10-15% of mothers worldwide.  Prevalence rates increase to 40% for mothers whose infant is admitted to the  NICU. PPD can affect maternal and child health across the life course and  predispose future generations to a myriad of developmental, psychosocial, and  physical challenges. Prevalence rates are higher for racial and ethnic  minorities, immigrant and refugee populations, and mothers in rural locations.  Trauma-informed care is suggested at individual and organizational levels,  leading to better care for those with and without previous trauma exposure.

In Denmark, the childhood vaccination programme has a coverage of  approximately 90%. To eliminate the disease, vaccine coverage needs to be above  the herd immunity threshold of 95%. This can be even more difficult to obtain,  when vaccination programmes break down due to war, natural disasters etc. and  concern has been raised, that unvaccinated refugees could facilitate spread of  measles when migrating. METHODS: In order to address this concern, we tested 513  newly arrived refugees and family reunified refugees aged between 0 and 70 years  for measles IgG antibodies. The participants were tested as part of a general  health assessment between May 2016 and October 2018. In the cohort, 50% were  males and the majority came from Syria (55%). RESULTS: We found that 85% of the  total group of refugees had immunity against measles. The 15% lacking antibodies  were evenly distributed between the various countries of origin. Moreover, we  found immunity to increase with age, leaving young children most vulnerable to  infection, 79.9% (<19 years) vs 89.1% (≥19 years).

The health of asylum-seeking children is of key  interest for healthcare providers, yet knowledge of the perspective of  asylum-seeking caregivers when accessing healthcare is limited. SETTING: The  study took place in a paediatric tertiary care hospital in Basel, Switzerland.  PARTICIPANTS: Interviews were done with 13 asylum-seeking caregivers who had  presented with their children at the paediatric tertiary care hospital. Nine  female and four male caregivers from Tibet, Eritrea, Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq,  Albania and Macedonia were included. A diverse sample was chosen regarding  cultural and social background, years of residence in Switzerland and reasons for  seeking care. A previously developed and pilot-tested interview guide was used  for semistructured in-depth interviews between 36 and 92 min in duration. Data  analysis and reporting was done according to Consolidated Criteria for Reporting  Qualitative Research. The number of interviews was determined by saturation of  data. RESULTS: The interviewees described a mismatch of personal competencies and  external challenges. Communication barriers and unfamiliarity with new health  concepts were reported as challenges. These were aggravated by isolation and  concerns about their child's health. The following factors were reported to  strongly contribute to satisfaction of healthcare delivery: a respectful and  trusting caregiver-provider relationship, the presence of interpreters and  immediate availability of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: A mismatch of personal  competencies and external challenges importantly influences the  caregiver-provider relationship. To overcome this mismatch establishment of  confidence was identified as a key factor. This can be achieved by availability  of interpreter services, sufficient consultation time and transcultural trainings  for healthcare workers.

Refugees experience a number of serious traumas, i.e.  death of family member or a close friend, physical, emotional or sexual abuse,  and at the same time have to confront poverty, hostility and racism during and  after the settlement in the host country. On the other hand, economic immigrants  have mainly to face adaption difficulties in a host country including racism,  poverty, different culture, bureaucracy. The aim of the current retrospective  study was to examine the differences in psychopathology between immigrants,  refugees and natives. We examined differences in psychiatric diagnoses and  factors influencing their health status between four groups: (i) 90 files of  children whose families referred to the Department of Child and Adolescent  Psychiatry (DeCAP), University of Athens, during 2005-2009, (ii) 216 files of  children whose families seek for help during 2010-2014. Immigrants who referred  to the DeCAP during the first period were mainly economic immigrants, whereas  immigrants of the second period were mainly refugees from countries in conflict.  These data were matched with age and sex with 151 files of natives who referred  to the DeCAP during the aforementioned decade: (iii) 72 Greek families who seek  for help during 2005-2009, and (iv) 79 Greek families who seek for help during  2010-2014. The Greek comparison group consisted of children and adolescents whose  parents were both Greek. Investigating the differences in psychiatric diagnoses  (F) and factors influencing health status (Z) between the groups, young refugees  received a greater number of Z compared to Greeks (2010-2014). The proportion of  refugees who had at least two Z was greater than that of immigrants and Greeks  2010-20014. Regarding the psychiatric diagnoses, Greek sample after 2010 received  a greater proportion of psychiatric diagnoses than refugees. These results  highlight that refugee families seek for help mainly not for psychiatric reasons.

The Impact of Trauma and Migration on a Mother's Ambivalence in Relation to her Child].,Sante mentale au Quebec,,1708-3923 0383-6320,,,"Objectives The objectives of this paper are to explore the impact of psychological trauma and migration on a mother's ambivalence regarding her  relationship with her child and to explore the effect on the child's ""continuity  of being."" Methods Literature on the ambivalence of mothers who have experienced  trauma and migration is reviewed. The authors present the hypothesis that the  presence of trauma and/or migration exacerbate the phenomenon of ambivalence and  that it may impact early interactions in mother-infant dyads. The stories of  three migrant dyads are presented to illustrate these processes. Results  Pregnancy is a period of psychological and identity reorganisation during which a  mother's ambivalence is as necessary as it is structuring for the child to come.  The stories of the three mother-infant dyads presented in this paper highlight  the impacts of migration and of traumatic experiences on entering motherhood in a  foreign country. These mothers' representations of their children are affected by  their ambivalence; the ""child as a savior"" and the ""child as a persecutor"" are in  constant conflict within the mothers' psyche. The act of giving life is rooted in  the mothers' histories and brings into question their very identities, their  parentage and affiliations, as influenced by the hardships they have experienced.  The arrival of a child is both a vulnerability factor as well as a source of  tremendous resiliency. Therefore, it is essential to reflect on how to best  welcome these mother-infant dyads in order to offer adapted and culturally  sensitive care. Conclusion This paper offers a deeper review of a clinical  reality often encountered in infant mental health with migrant and refugee  populations. The perinatal period coinciding with migration is one of increased  vulnerability and of potential revival of traumatic events. Giving birth in  exile, especially when struggling with psychological trauma may impact maternal  representations of their children. Children may then carry the burden of their  histories or, inversely, become a source of creative potential for the  mother-infant dyad. A transcultural approach is essential for a better  understanding of the complex processes involved in becoming a mother in the  context of trauma and/or migration and to improve care for mothers and their  developing offspring.",2020,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,,79-95,,2,45,,Sante Ment Que,,,,,,,,fre,,,,,,,Place: Canada PMID: 33651933,,,,"Humans; Female; Conflict, Psychological; Refugees/psychology; Infant; *Emigration and Immigration; Child Development; Mothers/*psychology; Culturally Competent Care; Mother-Child Relations/*psychology; Affect; Maternal Behavior/psychology; Pregnancy/psychology; Psychological Trauma/genetics/*psychology; Transients and Migrants/psychology",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No research has investigated how occupational therapists work  with child asylum seekers. The World Federation of Occupational Therapists  promotes the Canadian Model of Client-Centred Enablement (CMCE) for occupational  therapists working to promote human rights. AIMS/OBJECTIVES: This research  investigates use of CMCE skills to investigate skills occupational therapists use  when working with child asylum seekers in Australian immigration detention.  MATERIAL AND METHODS: Interpretive description guided this investigation and  purposive sampling was used to recruit 10 occupational therapists.  Semi-structured interviews were conducted and thematically analysed. RESULTS:  Occupational multi-level responsiveness, an overarching practice skill, involved  keying into individual, family and socio-political levels to respond to  occupational injustices. A wide array of practice skills extending beyond the  CMCE framework were used in a nuanced and interwoven manner spanning multiple  levels. CONCLUSIONS: Occupational multi-level responsiveness described  occupational therapists working across macro-, meso- and micro-levels.  SIGNIFICANCE: Understanding and enacting occupational multi-level responsiveness  may support occupational therapists to plan and implement effective strategies  when tackling occupational injustices. The skills identified may be applicable to  other complex socio-political fields of practice. More research is needed.  Further research should also investigate the occupational experiences of children  seeking asylum. KEY POINTSOccupational therapists working with child asylum  seekers in Australia take a multi-level approach, responding to individuals,  families and socio-political structures.A three pronged approach to  implementation of the occupational therapy practice process could support  multi-level responsiveness to enhance practice that addresses occupational  injustices.CMCE skills are not exhaustive and therapists discussed using other  skills beyond those listed in the CMCE.

The Westside Community Mental Health Center in San Francisco served as  the organizational hub for the Association for Black Psychologists (ABPsi) in the  1970s. The Westside clinicians understood forensic psychology as a kind of  preventative care as California, more so than any other state, was seduced by the  eugenic dream of human improvement through therapeutic interventions in schools  and prisons intended to correct the wayward deviant. Their community's mental  wellbeing required dismantling the interlinked disciplinary apparatus which  disproportionately surveyed, tracked, and confined young Black men. These  psychologists mounted a legal challenge to the use of intelligence testing to  sort Black children in schools, seeking to replace standardized tests with  ""dynamic assessments"" inspired by Israeli psychologist Reuven Feuerstein's work  with refugee children. They consulted on the voir dire process in the highly  politicized Angela Davis trial to minimize the presence of racially prejudiced  jurors. They offered expert testimony on the psychological damage of solitary  confinement on behalf of prison activists. The Westside team artfully developed  and deployed the psychological concept of ""bias"" in their confrontations with  local manifestations of the American carceral state. In their theoretical  writings, these psychologists reflected upon their historical positionality,  understanding themselves as products of the decolonial moment. Bay Area  encounters with Third World internationalism, the Black Panther Party (BPP), the  Nation of Islam, and community-led substance abuse programs shaped clinical care  at Westside and inspired the Afrocentric consciousness many came to espouse.  ABPsi initially had a significant impact on the historically white American  Psychological Association's training practices. However, the two organizations  split over the IQ controversy at a moment when psychologists became increasingly  enmeshed in the criminal justice system.",Oct-22,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,365-382,,4,58,,J Hist Behav Sci,,,,,,,,eng,© 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 35901240,,,,Humans; United States; Male; Child; San Francisco; Psychology; Prejudice; *Mental Health; Black People; *Expert Testimony; activism; Black psychology; carceral state; community mental health; forensic psychology; intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Considering the morbidity, mortality, and healthcare  spending, cancer is one of the leading health and economic burden for patients  and healthcare systems. However, very limited information available in the  scientific literature to understand the burden and characteristics of cancer in  countries hosting Syrian refugees. The aim of the present study is to evaluate  the demographic and clinical characteristics, treatment outcome of Syrian cancer  patients living in Konya, Turkey. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical  records of Syrian cancer patients at three major institutions from 2005 to 2020.  The information regarding demographic and clinical characteristics of patients  were identified. The number of days between the first symptom and diagnosis was  considered as the ""diagnostic interval"". Patients who failed to attend clinics  within four weeks of appointment were assumed abandoned treatment. Survival  curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: We identified 230  adult and 38 children refugee diagnosed with cancer during the study period. With  regards to adult patients, there were 114 (49.6%) male and 116 (50.4%) female.  The median age at diagnosis was 52.4, 47.3 years for male, female respectively.  The five most common cancer by site among all were; breast (24.8%), colorectal  (10.9%), lung (7.4%), central nervous system (CNS) (7.0%), and stomach (5.2%). 93  (40.4%) had metastatic disease at diagnosis. The overall survival probability was  37.5% at five years for the adult population. Data were extracted for 20 boys and  18 girls with childhood cancer. Their median age at diagnosis was 5.8 and  6.0 years respectively. The three most common childhood cancer were; leukemias  (21.1%), lymphomas (21.1%), and CNS (13.2%). Excluding leukemia, 13 (43.3%) of  childhood cancer cases had the advanced disease at diagnosis. Three year survival  probality was 69.5%. The median diagnostic interval for adult and childhood  cancer was 96.5 (IQR = 53-165) and 23 (IQR = 13.5-59) days respectively.  Twenty-one adults and four children had treatment abandonment.

We evaluated the relationship  between parent status (foreign-born vs. South African) and outcomes for children  with SAM admitted to a rural regional hospital in the Western Cape, South Africa.  METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted including children  &lt;5 years admitted to Worcester Provincial Hospital during 2015-17 with SAM  (WHO weight-for-height Z score &lt;-3, presence of nutritional oedema,  mid-upper-arm-circumference of &lt;11.5 cm or visible severe wasting). Exposures,  including parent status, and outcomes including in-hospital death were determined  from hospital and regional dietician records. RESULTS: Of 95 children included,  31 (33%) were of foreign-born and 64 (67%) of South African parents. Median  (interquartile range) age at admission was 12 (8-18) vs. 10 (8-13) months in  children of South African vs. foreign-born parents with no difference in preterm  birth, concurrent illnesses or admission duration.

This review aims to synthesise the available data on the delivery, coverage, and  effectiveness of the nutrition programmes for conflict affected women and  children living in LMICs. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and  PsycINFO databases and grey literature using terms related to conflict,  population, and nutrition. We searched studies on women and children receiving  nutrition-specific interventions during or within five years of a conflict in  LMICs. We extracted information on population, intervention, and delivery  characteristics, as well as delivery barriers and facilitators. Data on  intervention coverage and effectiveness were tabulated, but no meta-analysis was  conducted. RESULTS: Ninety-one pubblications met our inclusion criteria. Nearly  half of the publications (n=43) included population of sub-Saharan Africa (n=31)  followed by Middle East and North African region. Most publications (n=58)  reported on interventions targeting children under 5 years of age, and pregnant  and lactating women (n=27). General food distribution (n=34), micronutrient  supplementation (n=27) and nutrition assessment (n=26) were the most frequently  reported interventions, with most reporting on intervention delivery to refugee  populations in camp settings (n=63) and using community-based approaches. Only  eight studies reported on coverage and effectiveness of intervention. Key  delivery facilitators included community advocacy and social mobilisation,  effective monitoring and the integration of nutrition, and other sectoral  interventions and services, and barriers included insufficient resources,  nutritional commodity shortages, security concerns, poor reporting, limited  cooperation, and difficulty accessing and following-up of beneficiaries.  DISCUSSION: Despite the focus on nutrition in conflict settings, our review  highlights important information gaps. Moreover, there is very little information  on coverage or effectiveness of nutrition interventions; more rigorous evaluation  of effectiveness and delivery approaches is needed, including outside of camps  and for preventive as well as curative nutrition interventions.

However, growing access to  smartphones, among refugees, can be a leading factor to improve vaccination  rates. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine whether a smartphone app can  improve the vaccination uptake among refugees and determine the app's  effectiveness in improving the documentation of vaccination records. METHODS: We  developed and planned to test an app through a cluster randomized trial that will  be carried out at the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan. The study will be open to  all parents who carry Android smartphones, have at least one child, and agree to  participate in the study. The parents will be recruited to the study by trained  volunteers at the vaccination sites around the Zaatari camp. Inclusion criteria  will be the following: having at least one child of 0 to 5 years, being a local  resident of the camp, and having an Android smartphone. RESULTS: The intervention  includes an app that will allow storing Jordanian vaccination records, per child,  on the parents' smartphones in Arabic and English (in an interchangeable  fashion). Every record will have a set of automated reminders before the  appointment of each child. The app will summarize immunization records in form of  due, taken, or overdue appointments, labeled in orange, green, and red,  respectively. Baseline will include the collection of our primary and secondary  outcomes that are needed for the pre and postdata measurements. This includes  social demographic data, any previous vaccination history, and electronic health  literacy. Participants, in both study arms, will be monitored for their follow-up  visits to the clinic for vaccination doses. For the study outcome measures, we  will measure any differences in the uptake of vaccinations. The secondary outcome  is to analyze the effect of the children immunization app on visits for follow-up  doses. CONCLUSIONS: Owing to the limited evidence of effective interventions for  childhood vaccination among refugees, research in this area is greatly needed.  The project will have a significant impact on the health of refugees and the  public health system. In Jordan and the Middle East, the vaccination level is  low. Given the influx of refugees from the area, it is crucial to ensure a high  vaccination level among the children.

DESIGN: The measure is based on a socioecological model  of resilience and was developed and revised using community-based participatory  research methods with Aboriginal and refugee background communities. Pilot  testing and validation of the child-report version (Child Resilience  Questionnaire-Child report (CRQ- C)) is described in this paper. SETTING:  Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Children aged 7-12 years from culturally and socially  diverse backgrounds completed the CRQ- C in the pilot (n=387) and validation  study (n=775). Families recruited via hospital clinics, Aboriginal and refugee  background communities and nested follow-up of participants in an existing cohort  study. ANALYSIS: The factor structure and construct validity of CRQ-C scales were  assessed using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Preliminary  assessment of criterion validity was conducted usinghe Strengths and Difficulties  Questionnaire (SDQ). Internal consistency of final scales was assessed using  Cronbach's alpha. RESULTS: Conceptually developed CRQ-C was over inclusive of  resilience factors and items. Exploratory factor analyses and confirmatory factor  analyses supported 10 subscales reflecting personal resilience factors (positive  self/future, managing emotions) and connectedness to family, school and culture.  Excellent scale reliability (α=0.7-0.9) for all but one scale (Friends, α=0.6).  Significant negative correlation between CRQ-C and SDQ total difficulty score  supporting criterion validity (r(s)=-0.317, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The CRQ-C is a  new culturally and socially inclusive self-report measure of resilience factors  in childhood, with demonstrated content, construct and scale reliability.

As the social, economic,  and physical environment in which a child develops is a strong determinant of  health and wellbeing, a comprehensive approach that recognises the influence of  multidimensional deprivation on child wellbeing is needed. This study  investigates overlaps (co-occurrences) in deprivation indicators experienced by  Palestinian children compared to those experienced by other vulnerable children  living alongside them in Lebanon; children who are Syrian refugees (SYR) and  children who are Lebanese nationals (LBN). METHODS: This analysis adopted a  life-cycle approach using data from the UNICEF 2016 Lebanon Household Survey, and  included data on children aged 2-17 years (PRL, n=7106; PRS, n=2768; LBN,  n=10555; SYR n=5891). We report on indicators relating to early childhood (24-59  months) and school age (6-17 years), including child survival (nutrition, health,  water, sanitation, and overcrowding), child development (education), and child  protection (labour, exposure to violence, and early marriage), as well as the  co-occurrence of these deprivation indicators. Socio-demographic and geographical  correlates of child deprivation were explored using univariate and multivariable  logistic regression analysis, a using sampling weights and clustering for  children in the same households. Analyses were conducted using Stata 15.  FINDINGS: Among children aged 24-59 months, 28·9% (347 of 1202) of PRL and 46·2%  (260 of 563) of PRS children were deprived in at least two dimensions, compared  with 13·2% (67 of 508) of LBN and 68·5% (915 of 1335) of SYR children.  Co-occurring deprivations were highest across the protection and overcrowding  dimensions in Palestinian refugee children aged 6-17 years (PRL, 14·2% [769 of  5421]; PRS, 26·7% [531 of 1985]). Across all ages, PRS children were more likely  to be deprived in two dimensions than PRL children. However, indicators of health  and education deprivation were lower in PRL and PRS children than in SYR  children. Geographical disparities in deprivation existed within all four  populations, with the highest disparity among those living in North Lebanon and  the Bekaa. Higher maternal education (completed intermediate education) was  consistently associated with lower odds of having at least two concurrent  deprivations among children aged 6-17 years (LBN odds ratio [OR] 0·1, 95% CI  0·1-0·2, p<0·0001; PRL OR 0·3, 95% CI 0·3-0·5, p<0·0001; PRS OR 0·5, 95% CI  0·3-0·7, p=0·0002; SYR OR 0·4, 95% CI 0·2-0·7, p=0·0004). INTERPRETATION: The  most common overlaps in deprivation indicators were in housing (overcrowding) and  protection (exposure to violence) among PRL and PRS children, highlighting the  need to focus simultaneously on housing improvements and protection programmes.  Deprivation in health and education were relatively low as PRS children have been  included in the well-established UNRWA health and education systems, largely  protecting them from poor health and education outcomes.

DESIGN: Systematic literature review. DATA  SOURCES: The following search engines were searched from 2008 - 2018: Allied and  Complementary Medicine Database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health,  MEDLINE, Embase, ProQuest, Scopus, Psycinfo, and Web of Science. Extensive  reference and citation checking were also conducted. REVIEW METHODS: Systematic  review followed PRISMA guidelines with prepared PROSPERO registered protocol  #CRD42019129200. English language qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods  studies were eligible for inclusion. Study quality was appraised using the Mixed  Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT). RESULTS: Eighteen studies (reported in 20  articles) met the final inclusion criteria. Most focused on challenges to care  provision. Thematic analysis following methods proposed by Braun and Clarke was  undertaken. Five themes were identified: (a) divergence of beliefs and  expectations; (b) communication; (c) navigating healthcare systems; (d) burdens  and coping strategies; and (e) training and knowledge. A compassionate,  collaborative approach with mutual respect crossed themes and was linked to  high-quality care. CONCLUSION: Forced migrant families have multiple needs  including physical and emotional support and help in navigating complex systems.  Professional interpreters can ease communication barriers when resourced  appropriately. Individualized care is crucial to addressing the intricate mosaic  of culture such families present. A cultural sensitivity/insensitivity framework  is presented that may help guide future interactions and priorities for those  working in children's palliative care. IMPACT: This systematic review explored  the international experiences of palliative care for forced migrant families. The  findings highlight the plight of families who experience multiple traumas and  increased levels of grief and loss through their migration experiences and when  caring for a child with a life-limiting condition.

To inform how a vaccine tracking app such as CANImmunize might be tailored to  meet the unique needs of newcomers, this study sought to determine commonly  spoken languages, technology use, and current methods of vaccine tracking among  recent newcomers to Canada. METHODS: Government-assisted refugees attending a  health clinic in Ottawa, Canada were invited to complete a 17-question needs  assessment survey. The survey captured data on household demographics, spoken  languages, country of origin, technology use and methods used to track  vaccination history. RESULTS: 50 newcomers completed the needs assessment survey.  Arabic was the predominant language spoken by surveyed individuals. Although 92%  of participants owned a smartphone, the majority did not actively use digital  health applications. 18 (36%) participants reported being vaccinated before  arriving in Canada. 27 (54%) participants were parents, 23 of whom reported that  their children were vaccinated prior to arrival in Canada. 38 (76%) participants  indicated that they would use a vaccine tracking app such as CANImmunize if it  were translated into their primary language of communication.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: These consisted of sexual  assaults (2 instances of rape and 1 of sexual interference) on sexually immature  females (young girls) by patients with sexually transmitted infections (mainly  HIV, syphilis) hoping they might thereby be cured. DISCUSSION: These particularly  atrocious hetero-aggressive sexual practices based on magical arguments are  unfortunately universal and are not limited to a specific culture. At the medical  anthropology level, the belief in cleansing by virgins is based on the notion  that the patient is dirty and impure. In the same way that emetics and/or  laxatives are prescribed in the case of intestinal disorders (to ""eliminate"" the  disease), some subjects use diuretics for urinary abnormalities or, literally,  ""clean vaginas (or anuses)"" to purge their own miasma. The rising tide of  population migrations (some of whom carry chronic infections), refugee camps,  prolonged incarcerations, etc., makes observations of such phenomena increasingly  frequent. Belief in cleansing by virgins (and the fatal consequences thereof)  will be difficult to eradicate.

In response to measles and  diphtheria cases, first documented in September and November 2017, respectively,  vaccination campaigns targeting children <15 years old were mobilized during  September 2017-March 2018. However, in a rapidly evolving emergency situation,  poor sanitation, malnutrition, overcrowding, and lack of access to safe water and  healthcare can increase susceptibility to infectious diseases, particularly among  children. We aimed to estimate population immunity to vaccine-preventable  diseases (VPDs) after vaccination activities in the camps to identify any  remaining immunity gaps among Rohingya children. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We  conducted a cross-sectional serologic and vaccination coverage survey in Nayapara  Registered Refugee Camp (""Nayapara"") and makeshift settlements (MSs) April 28,  2018 to May 31, 2018, among 930 children aged 6 months to 14 years. MSs are  informal, self-settled areas with a population of more than 850,000, the majority  of whom arrived after August 2017, whereas Nayapara is a registered camp and has  better infrastructure than MSs, including provision of routine immunization  services. Households were identified using simple random sampling (SRS) in  Nayapara and multistage cluster sampling in MSs (because household lists were  unavailable). Dried blood spots (DBSs) were collected to estimate seroprotection  against measles, rubella, diphtheria, and tetanus, using Luminex multiplex bead  assay (MBA). Caregiver interviews assessed vaccination campaign participation  using vaccination card or recall. In Nayapara, 273 children aged 1 to 6 years  participated; 46% were female and 88% were registered refugees. In MSs, 358  children aged 1 to 6 years and 299 children aged 7 to 14 years participated; 48%  of all children in MSs were female, and none were registered refugees. In  Nayapara, estimated seroprotection among 1- to 6-year-olds was high for measles,  rubella, diphtheria, and tetanus (91%-98%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 87%-99%);  children >6 years were not assessed. In MSs, measles seroprotection was similarly  high among 1- to 6-year-olds and 7- to 14-year-olds (91% [95% CI 86%-94%] and 99%  [95% CI 96%-100%], respectively, p < 0.001). Rubella and diphtheria  seroprotection in MSs were significantly lower among 1- to 6-year-olds (84% [95%  CI 79%-88%] and 63% [95% CI 56%-70%]) compared to 7- to 14-year-olds (96% [95% CI  90%-98%] and 77% [95% CI 69%-84%]) (p < 0.001). Tetanus seroprevalence was  similar among 1- to 6-year-olds and 7- to 14-year-olds (76% [95% CI 69%-81%] and  84% [95% CI 77%-89%], respectively; p = 0.07). Vaccination campaign coverage was  consistent with seroprotection in both camps. However, nonresponse, the main  limitation of the study, may have biased the seroprotection and campaign coverage  results. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed that despite multiple  vaccination campaigns, immunity gaps exist among children in MSs, particularly  for diphtheria, which requires serial vaccinations to achieve maximum protection.  Therefore, an additional tetanus-diphtheria campaign may be warranted in MSs to  address these remaining immunity gaps. Rapid scale-up and strengthening of  routine immunization services to reach children and to deliver missed doses to  older children is also critically needed to close immunity gaps and prevent  future outbreaks.",Mar-20,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,e1003071,,3,17,,PLoS Med,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 32231368  PMCID: PMC7108726,,,,"Humans; Prevalence; Female; Cross-Sectional Studies; Male; Child; Adolescent; Child, Preschool; Infant; Refugees/*statistics & numerical data; Vaccination/*statistics & numerical data; Bangladesh/epidemiology; Myanmar/ethnology; Seroepidemiologic Studies; Vaccine-Preventable Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology/*therapy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We developed an app and tested it  through a non-randomized trial at the Zaatari refugees camp in Jordan. The study  was conducted during March - December 2019 at three vaccination clinics inside  the camp. The study included two study groups (intervention and control groups)  for refugees living at the camp. The intervention group included parents who own  an Android smartphone and have one newborn that require between one and four  first vaccination doses and they accepted to participate in the study, during  their regular visit to the vaccination clinics. The control group was for the  usual care. We compared both study groups for returning back to one follow-up  visit, using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. We recruited 936 babies (n = 471;  50.3% in the intervention group, both study groups were similar at baseline). The  majority of mothers were literate (94.2%) with a median age of 24. The majority  of the babies had a vaccination card (n = 878, 94%). One quarter (26%) of  mother-babies pairs of the intervention group came back within one week (versus  22% for control group); When it comes to lost-follow-up, 22% and 28% did not have  a history of returning back (intervention and control groups respectively,  p = 0.06) (Relative risk reduction: 19%).

To address this problem, integrated child  health interventions that include support for the well-being of mothers must be  adapted and assessed in humanitarian settings. Baby Friendly Spaces (BFS) is a  holistic program that aims to improve the health and wellbeing of pregnant and  lactating women and their children under two years of age by providing  psychosocial support and enhancing positive infant and young child-care  practices. Using a mixed-methods, pre-post design, this study explored ways to  strengthen the implementation and acceptability of the BFS program, and assess  outcomes associated with participation among South Sudanese mothers and their  children living in the Nguenyyiel refugee camp in Gambella, Ethiopia. DISCUSSION:  A stronger evidence-base for integrated maternal and child health interventions,  like BFS, in humanitarian emergencies is needed, but effectively conducting this  type of research in unstable settings means encountering and working through  myriad challenges. In this paper we discuss lessons learned while implementing  this study, including, challenges related to ongoing local political and tribal  conflicts and extreme conditions; implementation of a new digital data monitoring  system; staff capacity building and turnover; and measurement were encountered.  Strategies to mitigate such challenges included hiring and training new staff  members. Regular weekly skype calls were held between Action Against Hunger Paris  headquarters, the Action Against Hunger team in Gambella and Johns Hopkins'  academic partners to follow study implementation progress and troubleshoot any  emerging issues. Staff capacity building strategies included holding brief and  focused trainings continuously throughout the study for both new and current  staff members. Lastly, we engaged local Nuer staff members to help ensure study  measures and interview questions were understandable among study participants.  CONCLUSIONS: Research focused on strengthening program implementation is  critically important for improving maternal and child health in humanitarian  emergencies. Research in such settings demands critical problem-solving skills,  strong supervision systems, flexibility in timeline and logistics, and  tailor-made training for program and research staff members and context- adapted  strategies for retaining existing staff.",2020,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,52,,,14,,Confl Health,,,,,,,,eng,© The Author(s) 2020.,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 32724334  PMCID: PMC7382810,,,,Psychosocial support; Refugees; Ethiopia; Breastfeeding; Child care practices; Humanitarian emergencies; Process evaluation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our study aimed  to assess anaemia prevalence and undernutrition indicators among new entrant  school children during their preschool medical examination. SETTINGS: In 2017, we  conducted a cross-sectional study in 59 UNRWA HCs, targeting children entering  first grade at UNRWA schools in four of UNRWA's countries of operation (known as  fields), namely Gaza, West Bank, Syria and Lebanon. PARTICIPANTS: 2419 completed  the study. Boys and girls living inside or outside Palestine refugee camps were  included. Verbal consent was obtained from their parents. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY  OUTCOME MEASURES: Sociodemographic and anthropometric data on each child were  collected. Underweight (weight-for-age z-score <-2 SD), stunting (height-for-age  z-score <-2 SD), thinness (body mass index-for-age z-score <-2 SD) and obesity  (body mass index-for-age z-score >+2 SD) were examined according to WHO growth  indicators (5-10 years). RESULTS: 2419 students (1278 girls and 1141 boys) aged  6.1±0.4 years were examined. The prevalence of anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb)  <11.5 g/L) was 25.0% (Gaza: 29.3%; West Bank: 22.0%; Syria: 30.0%; Lebanon:  18.3%). The mean Hb level was 12.0±0.9 g/L. The overall prevalence of stunting,  thinness and underweight was 3.2%, 3.5% and 5.6%, respectively, with the highest  levels found in Syria (4.3%, 6.3% and 10.1%, respectively). The highest  prevalence of overweight was in Lebanon (8.6%), and the lowest was in Gaza  (2.6%). Significant differences were found among fields with regard to  undernutrition indicators (p=0.001). Also, children with anaemia had  significantly higher prevalence of being underweight (5.2%) in comparison with  those without anaemia (p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of anaemia among the  surveyed children increased to 25.0%, compared with the previous study conducted  by UNRWA in 2005 (19.5%).

This article aimed  to present a case study report of several years' experience of tailor-made group  health promotion intervention. It describes as an example, a project during  autumn 2018 in five municipalities of Sweden and in collaboration between  academia, primary care, social welfare, police, and an NGO. Fifty-one women,  Arabic- or Somalian speaking, with 1-7 children, mean age 40 years, low-educated  and in average four years' of living in Sweden participated. Under supervision, a  local female member of the NGO coordinated the group meetings in Swedish with up  to ten participants and the moderators were representatives of healthcare, social  services and police/lawyer, with an interpreter present. Each intervention  focused on human rights, health including mental health, psychosocial and  parenting support, by using a 5-week group intervention a 2 h/week, totally 10 h  excluding pre- and post-evaluation, and one language per intervention. Each  meeting included 1-h lecture and after a short break with refreshments, the  participants asked questions to the respective moderator. It was a mixed method  but emphasis on qualitative design and participatory methodology with co-creation  and evaluation of the intervention. The results showed that this tailor-made  group intervention gave the participants empowerment and a sense of coherence,  MHL and tools to deal with stress/anxiety, based on their needs that were mapped  before in a pilot study during Spring 2018, indirectly addressing their children.  However, they did not primarily talk about mental illness experience. It is vital  that these interventions toward the target group with limited exposure to Western  concepts (e.g., illness, anxiety, and trauma), may bridge the gap between Western  and traditional cultural understanding of pre- and postmigration stress. In  conclusion, MHL may be a function of both the cultural origin of the target  group's background and their resettlement in a Western reception country.

There have been 30 000 COVID-19 cases,  positivity rates exceeding 50%, and 9 deaths in Immigration and Customs  Enforcement custody, but the extent of disease among children under the care of  the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) has not been well-documented. We sought  to evaluate the burden of COVID-19 among unaccompanied minors under the ORR's  responsibility. METHODS: We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 testing results of refugees and  asylum seekers in facilities associated with the ORR from February 1, 2020, to  November 18, 2020, courtesy of a Freedom of Information Act request. RESULTS: ORR  facilities performed 7132 SARS-CoV-2 tests from March 13, 2020, to November 18,  2020. Overall, the SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate was 13.4%. Factors associated with  higher positivity rates were age group (16-17 years old); identifying as male;  undergoing testing in April, August, or September; staying in a for-profit versus  a nonprofit facility; and detention in certain facilities. The mean detention  time with a positive test was 14.8 ± 3.2 days. Greater than 10% of positive tests  were in long-term detainees. CONCLUSIONS: The high SARS-CoV-2 test positivity  rate raises concerns about an inability to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 within  detention facilities housing unaccompanied migrant children, particularly those  run by for-profit companies. Mandated measures for social distancing and  vaccination among detainees and detention facility employees are needed to limit  the spread of the virus.",2023-02-08,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,e101-e107,,3,76,,Clin Infect Dis,,,,,,,,eng,"© The Author(s) 2022.

It has been hypothesised that this is due to prevention  strategies failing to account for the influence of social determinants (such as  ethnicity, socioeconomic status). Populations such as ethnic minorities have been  over-represented in injury statistics, however this is not well explored in  drowning. This study aims to identify high-risk populations for drowning, risk  factors and prevention strategies. METHODS: A literature review undertaken  systematically using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and  Meta-Analyses approach was conducted of peer-reviewed literature in English,  published between 1990 and 2018 from high-income countries. Search terms included  drowning, water safety, ethnic minority, migrant, and culturally diverse.  RESULTS: In total, 35 articles were included. High-risk populations identified  were: ethnic minorities, First Nations/Aboriginal people, migrants and rural  residents. Over half (51%) focused on children (0-18 years). Risk factors  included social determinants, swimming ability and knowledge, attitudes and  behaviour. Four intervention studies were found; two focused on upskilling adults  from high-risk populations to increase employment opportunities within the  aquatic industry; an evaluation of a 10-year rock fishing safety education  project and a learn-to-swim programme for minority children. Proposed prevention  strategies included education, practical skills, research, policy and engagement.  DISCUSSION: Limited literature exists pertaining to drowning among adults from  high-risk populations. There is a need to increase the sophistication of drowning  prevention strategies addressing the disparities in drowning from a culturally  appropriate perspective. Acknowledging the role of the social determinants of  health in drowning prevention is essential in order to improve drowning outcomes  for high-risk populations globally.",Jun-20,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,279-288,,3,26,,Inj Prev,,,,,,,,eng,© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

There is growing concern about the  healthcare needs of the 54,560 Syrian refugees who were admitted to Canada by May  2018, 80% of whom are women and children. We explored the healthcare needs of  newcomer Syrian women, their experiences in accessing and using health services,  and the factors and conditions that shape whether and how they access and utilize  health services in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). METHOD: This community-based  qualitative descriptive interpretive study was informed by Yang & Hwang (2016)  health service utilization framework. Focus group discussions were held with 58  Syrian newcomer women in the GTA. These discussions were conducted in Arabic,  audio-recorded with participants' consent, translated into English and  transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Participants' health  concerns included chronic, long-term conditions as well as new and emerging  issues. Initial health insurance and coverage were enabling factors to access to  services, while language and social disconnection were barriers. Other factors,  such as beliefs about naturopathic medicine, settlement in suburban areas with  limited public transportation, and lack of linguistically, culturally, and  gender-appropriate services negatively affected access to and use of healthcare  services.

Herein, an equity-focused commentary on  the current climate of oral healthcare in Canada is presented. We outline how  addressing disparities in Canadian dental care will require the engagement of  physicians on multiple levels of care, negotiation with both dentists and  policymakers, as well as sustained oral health data collection to inform  provincial and national decision-making/strategies.",Feb-23,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,139-145,,1,114,,Can J Public Health,,,,,,,,eng,© 2022.

Here we propose that the  Jewish psychiatrist Georg Frankl, who worked with both Asperger and Kanner, had  more than a marginal role in the early history of autism. While Hans Asperger did  not recognize the talent of his superior Georg Frankl, Leo Kanner immediately  recognized his merits and acumen when Georg Frankl arrived at the Johns Hopkins  as a refugee. This proposal is supported by the retrieval of an unpublished  Frankl's manuscript on autism which is here analysed and that deserves credit for  anticipating some of the contemporary visions of autism. The manuscript deepens  the distinction between 'affective language' and 'word language' that George  Frankl had already developed in his previous papers in 1933 and 1943. While in  neurotypical subjects the everyday language is an integration of affective and  word language, autistic children register a break between them and, according to  Frankl, this break is at the core of autism and can have a wide range of  expression and tentatives of compensation. It is also proposed that the  centrality of disturbances in affective language can be in agreement with a  vision of autism as a neurodevelopmental disorder that interferes with the  current notions of intersubjectivity, intercorporeality and interaffectivity.  Frankl's perspective about autism can still be considered innovative today for  other reasons. He proposed that autism could cover a spectrum of conditions; that  it is a state of mind that is not necessarily abnormal; that it is a  neurobiological condition that needs to be understood by others before of being  modified. Finally the conceptualization of autism as a disturbance of affective  language is in agreement with the DSM-5 which has created a sociocommunicative  domain that comprises only deficits in non-verbal communication (that is  affective language), putting the verbal language (that is word language) as a  specificator outside the diagnostic criteria.",Aug-19,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,,159-164,,4,16,,Clin Neuropsychiatry,,,,,,,,eng,© 2019 Giovanni Fioriti Editore s.r.l.,,,,,,Place: Italy PMID: 34908951  PMCID: PMC8650195,,,,autism; affective contact; affective language; Georg Frankl; word language,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is increasing evidence that spending  time in nature is beneficial for wellbeing. Nature-based interventions have been  developed to support mental health, but not specifically tailored for mothers  during the postnatal period. Understanding mothers' views and experiences of  nature would help determine the suitability for and potential impact of such  interventions on postnatal wellbeing. AIMS: To explore mothers' views on the  impact of spending time in nature on their postnatal mental wellbeing. METHODS:  Focus groups were held with mothers of young children (under five), including  mothers from migrant and refugee communities, mothers living with mental health  difficulties, and disabled mothers. Data were analysed using reflexive thematic  analysis. RESULTS: Four focus groups were held, with a total of 30 participants.  Six themes were developed: (1) mothers' experiences of what constitutes 'nature';  (2) sensing nature improves wellbeing; (3) natural spaces facilitate human  connection; (4) nature provides escape and relief from daily indoor stressors;  (5) nature allows new perspectives; and (6) mothers face a variety of  environmental, practical, psychological, physical, socioeconomic, and cultural  barriers to spending time in nature during the postnatal period.

We aimed to  retrospectively research the etiologic, sociodemographic, and clinical factors in  CKD among Syrian refugee children, and at the same time, to compare the clinical  characteristics of patients with ESRD on peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis.  METHODS: Our study included a total of 79 pediatric Syrian patients aged from  2-16 years monitored at Hatay State Hospital pediatric nephrology clinic with  diagnosis of various stages of CKD and with ESRD. Physical-demographic features  and clinical-laboratory information were retrospectively screened. RESULTS: The  most common cause of CKD was congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary  tracts (CAKUT) (37.9%). Other causes were urolitiasis (15.1%), nephrotic syndrome  (10.1%), spina bifida (8.8%), hemolytic uremic syndrome (7.5%), and  glomerulonephritis (7.5%).

We describe a replicable model of eye care provision as delivered by  Orbis International and local partners to the Rohingya and host population in  Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, and characterize the burden of vision impairment and  demand for sight-restoring services in this setting. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Orbis  International and local secondary facility Cox's Bazar Baitush Sharaf Hospital  (CBBSH) provide eye care support to the Rohingya population and the host  community of all ages in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, with fixed vision screening  locations established in Camps 4 and 11 of the Kutupalong refugee settlement.  Structured outreach targets these camps and four surrounding local subdistricts,  with referrals made as needed for refraction (glasses measurement) and cataract  surgery to CBBSH. Between February 2018 and March 2019, 48,105 displaced Rohingya  (70.3%, among whom 71.6% were children and 46.5% women) and 20,357 local  residents (29.7%, 88.5% children, 54.4% women) underwent vision screening.  Displaced Rohingya sought services from a total of 12 surrounding camps, within  which coverage was 17.3%, including 43.3% (27,027/62,424) of children aged 5-11  years and 60.0% (5,315/8,857) of adults ≥ 60 years old. The prevalence of  blindness (presenting acuity < 3/60) among Rohingya patients exceeded that among  local residents by 3- to 6-fold in each 10-year age group between 18 and 59 years  (P < 0.001 comparing vision between the two groups in this age range), and the  prevalence of cataract requiring surgery was also higher in Rohingya patients  (18-29 years: 4.67% versus 1.80%, P = 0.0019; 30-39: 7.61% versus 2.39%, P <  0.001; and 40-49 years: 7.91% versus 3.77%, P = 0.0014). A limitation of the  study is lack of data on population prevalence of eye disease. CONCLUSIONS: The  burden of untreated eye disease is very high among the Rohingya, particularly  those in their peak working years who could contribute most to the resiliency of  their community.

According to the World Health Organization, many health systems in Europe have  not yet adapted adequately to the needs of asylum-seekers, which might result in  untimely and inefficient health care for asylum-seeking patients. The aim of this  study was to assess the number of preventable hospital admissions and emergency  department visits in asylum-seeking and non-asylum-seeking pediatric patients.  METHODS: This is a retrospective, hospital-based study. The study was done at the  University Children's Hospital Basel in Switzerland. Patients admitted or  presenting to the emergency department were included and split into the groups of  asylum-seeking and non-asylum-seeking patients. All admissions and  emergency-department visits were extracted from the administrative electronic  health records from 1st Jan 2016-31st Dec 2017. The main outcome was the  proportion of admissions due to ambulatory-care-sensitive conditions (which refer  to conditions for which admission can be prevented by early interventions in  primary care) in asylum-seeking and non-asylum-seeking patients.  Ambulatory-care-sensitive conditions were defined by a validated list of ICD-10  codes. The secondary objective was to assess the number of preventable  emergency-department visits by asylum-seeking patients defined as proportion of  visits with a non-urgent triage score. RESULTS: A total of 75'199 hospital visits  were included, of which 63'405 were emergency department visits and 11'794 were  admissions. Ambulatory-care-sensitive conditions accounted for 12.1% (18/149) of  asylum-seeking and 10.9% (1270/11645) of non-asylum seeking patients' admissions.  Among the emergency department visits by asylum-seeking patients, non-urgent  conditions accounted for 82.2% (244/297).

EMA is an ideal tool to measure weight-related behaviors, such as parental  feeding practices, stress, and dietary intake, as these occur on a daily basis  and vary across time and context. A recent systematic review recommended  standardized reporting of EMA design for studies that address weight-related  behaviors. OBJECTIVE: To answer the call for reporting study designs using EMA,  this paper describes in detail the EMA design of the Family Matters study and how  it was adapted over time to improve functionality and meet the needs of a  racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse sample. METHODS: Family  Matters is an incremental, 2-phased, mixed methods study, conducted with a  racially and ethnically diverse, immigrant and refugee sample from largely  low-income households, designed to examine risk and protective factors for child  weight and weight-related behaviors in the home environment. The Family Matters  study intentionally recruited White, Black, Hmong, Latino, Native American, and  Somali parents with young children. Parents in phase 1 of the study completed 8  days of EMA on their smartphones, which included signal-contingent surveys (eg,  asking about the parent's stress at the time of the survey), event-contingent  surveys (eg, descriptions of the meal the child ate), and end-of-day surveys (eg,  overall assessment of the child's day). RESULTS: A detailed description of EMA  strategies, protocols, and methods used in phase 1 of the Family Matters study is  provided. Compliance with EMA surveys and participants' time spent completing EMA  surveys are presented and stratified by race and ethnicity. In addition, lessons  learned while conducting phase 1 EMA are shared to document how EMA methods were  improved and expanded upon for phase 2 of the Family Matters study. CONCLUSIONS:  The results from this study provided an important next step in identifying best  practices for EMA use in assessing weight-related behaviors in the home  environment.

METHODS: This multicenter  cross-sectional study recruited 544 refugees aged 3-75+ years; they were examined  at ten registration institutions in four federal states in Germany by two  calibrated dentists. The refugees were screened for caries (dmft/DMFT) and its  complications (pufa/PUFA); this data was compared to the resident population via  the representative national oral health surveys). RESULTS: The deciduous  dentition of the 3-year-old refugees had a mean dmft value of 2.62 ± 3.6 compared  with 0.48 dmft in the German resident population, and caries increased to 5.22 ±  3.4 for 6-7-year-olds (Germany: 1.73 dmft). Few refugee children had naturally  healthy teeth (7% in 6-7-year-olds, Germany: 56%). In the permanent dentition,  the gap in caries prevalence between refugees and the German population decreased  with age (35-44-year-olds: 10.55 ± 7.1 DMFT; Germany: 11.2), but refugees  exhibited more caries defects (35-44-year-olds DT = 3.13 ± 3.0; Germany: 0.5).  German residents had more restorations (35-44-year-olds FT = 4.21 ± 4.6).  Regarding complications, the 6-7-year-olds exhibited the highest pufa index (0.86  ± 1.4) which decreased in adolescence (13-17-year-olds, 0.18 ± 0.6) and increased  in adults (45-64-year-olds, 0.45 ± 0.8). CONCLUSION: The refugees had high caries  experience, often untreated caries teeth and more complications compared with the  German resident population, especially in children. Closing this gap by extending  preventive systems to the refugees would decrease future treatment needs.

One barrier to screening is the availability of validated measures in the woman's  language. Afghanistan is one of the largest source countries for refugees yet  there is no validated measure in Dari to screen for symptoms of perinatal  depression and anxiety. The aim of this study was to assess the screening  properties of a Dari translation of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale.  METHODS: This cross-sectional study administered the Edinburgh Postnatal  Depression Scale Dari version to 52 Dari-speaking women at a public pregnancy  clinic in Melbourne, Australia. A clinical interview using the depressive and  anxiety disorders modules from the Structured Clinical Interview for the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.) was also  conducted. Interview material was presented to an expert panel to achieve  consensus diagnoses. The interview and diagnostic process was undertaken blind to  Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale screening results. RESULTS: Cronbach's alpha  coefficient for the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale Dari version was good  (α = 0.79). Criterion validity was assessed using the receiver operating  characteristics curve and generated excellent classification accuracy for  depression diagnosis (0.90; 95% confidence interval [0.82, 0.99]) and for anxiety  diagnosis (0.94; 95% confidence interval [0.88, 1.00]). For depression, a cut-off  score of 9, as recommended for culturally and linguistically diverse groups,  demonstrated high sensitivity (1.00; 95% confidence interval [0.79, 1.00]) and  specificity (0.88; 95% confidence interval [0.73, 0.97]). For anxiety, a cut-off  score of ⩾5 provided the best balance of sensitivity (1.00; 95% confidence  interval [0.72, 1.00]) and specificity (0.80; 95% confidence interval [0.65,  0.91]).

DESIGN: Household Food Insecurity Assess Scale  measurement was applied to assess food insecurity, anxiety and uncertainty,  insufficient quality and insufficient food intake. Descriptive analysis and  multivariable regression models were used to determine the associated factors.  SETTING: The study was carried out in urban areas of Tehran province in Iran.  PARTICIPANTS: To collect data, interviews were conducted among 317 Afghan  households. The questionnaire was administered via face-to-face interviews to  either the breadwinner of the selected households or a member who could respond  on behalf of the household. RESULTS: About 11·3 % of Afghan households who  resettled in Tehran province were food secure, while 11·7 % were marginally, 40·7  % moderately and 36·3 % severely food insecure. Economic and financial factors  were inversely and significantly associated with food insecurity. Employment,  income, distance from the central market and personal saving were inversely  associated with food insecurity, while other determinants, including the length  of living time in Tehran, house type and the number of male and female children,  had a direct association with food insecurity.

To identify  general trends, and to detect gaps in the existing knowledge about the  socioeconomic and health status of these young refugees, this review discusses  the literature regarding three key areas related to welfare policy: health,  education and employment. Methods: A systematic search in PubMed, Scopus,  SocINDEX, Sociological Abstracts, Embase and Cochrane, and a search for  publications from relevant institutions were undertaken. All publications had to  be original quantitative studies published since 1980. The total number of  studies identified was 1353, 25 publications were included. Results: Young  refugees had poorer mental health than ethnic minority and native-born peers.  Mental health problems were related to pre-migration experiences but also to  post-migration factors, such as discrimination and poor social support. Refugees  performed worse in school than native-born and few progressed to higher  education. Experiencing less discrimination and having better Nordic language  proficiency was associated with higher educational attainment. A higher  proportion of refugees were unemployed or outside the labour force compared with  other immigrants and native-born. Assessment instruments varied between studies,  making comparisons difficult. Conclusions: The study suggests pre-migration  factors but also post-migration conditions such as perceived discrimination,  social support and Nordic language proficiency as important factors for the  mental health, education and employment outcomes of young refugees in the Nordic  countries.

Affected children may experience social problems due to  negative effects on speech, hearing, facial appearance, as well as negative  psychological effects on the parents. In 2011, after the civil war began in  Syria, a great wave of immigration began to Turkey and other neighboring  countries. Refugees may not be able to receive optimal health care because of  cultural differences, socioeconomic status, language problems, and psychosocial  problems. To increase awareness about this issue, the authors investigated the  demographic, perioperative, and post-operative data of Syrian refugee patients  with CL/P who were admitted to our cleft center between January 2016 and May  2019. Sixty-eight refugees with CL/P were detected as the result of the  screening.

METHODS: A systematic review was conducted from the  search in seven bibliographic databases. Studies on the prevalence of SV among  refugees and asylum seekers of any country, sex or age, whether in English,  French, Spanish and Portuguese, were eligible. RESULTS: Of the 2,906 titles  found, 60 articles were selected. The reported prevalence of SV was largely  variable (0% to 99.8%). Reports of SV were collected in all continents, with 42%  of the articles mentioning it in refugees from Africa (prevalence from 1.3% to  100%). The rape was the most reported SV in 65% of the studies (prevalence from  0% to 90.9%). The main victims were women in 89% of the studies, all the way,  especially when still in the countries of origin. The SV was perpetrated  particularly by intimate partners, but also by agents of supposed protection.

With  the long-term goal of improving wellbeing and quality of life, this multi-method  study aims to develop a self-care and self-development intervention guidebook for  asylum-seeking adolescents. The SC-SD4ASA project will focus on three main work  packages: 1. assessment of needs and knowledge concerning self-care and  self-development; 2. development of a guidebook to promote self-care and  self-development for asylum-seeking adolescents; and 3. assessment of the  guidebook fidelity, reliability, and validity. For the first work package, an  intra-triangulation approach including three qualitative methods [in-depth  interviews, focus group discussions and photographic means (photovoice)] will be  used. The collected data will be analyzed using cross-cultural and multilingual  approach to thematic analysis, known as meta-theme analysis. The results of the  first stage will be utilized for developing the guidebook in the second (main)  work packages. The guidebook fidelity will be assessed based on the National  Institutes of Health Behavior Change Consortium fidelity framework in the last  workplan. Empowering asylum-seeking adolescents with self-care /self-development  skills can help them to sustain their wellbeing and better manage the challenges  in their new situation. When successfully implemented, a guidebook will be  developed to support all individuals involved in planning, managing, and  promoting health among asylum-seeking adolescents that can be used for future  self-care/self-development programs in practice.",2022,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,736673,,,10,,Front Public Health,,,,,,,,eng,"Copyright © 2022 Mohammadzadeh, Heinrichs, Pilz González and Stock.",,,,,,Place: Switzerland PMID: 35937206  PMCID: PMC9353327,,,,Humans; United States; Child; Adolescent; Reproducibility of Results; Quality of Life; *Refugees/psychology; refugee crisis; Delivery of Health Care; *Self Care; asylum-seeking adolescents; intervention development; multi-method analysis; self-care; self-development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Linked individual-level administrative data were used to construct a  cohort of individuals born in 1990-1998 and residing in South-Western BC  (n = 193,400). Cases were identified by either one hospitalization or two  outpatient physician visits within 2 years with a primary diagnosis of a  non-affective psychotic disorder (ICD-10: F20-29, ICD-9: 295, 297, 298). We  estimated cumulative incidence, annual cumulative incidence and incidence rate  between the ages of 13 and 19 years, and conducted Cox proportional hazards  regression to estimate associations between sociodemographic factors and risk  over the study period. RESULTS: We found that 0.64% of females and 0.88% of males  were diagnosed with a non-affective psychotic disorder between the ages of 13 and  19 years, with increasing risk observed over the age range, especially amongst  males. Incidence rate over the entire study period was 106 per 100,000  person-years for females and 145 per 100,000 person-years for males. Risk of  diagnosis was elevated amongst those in low-income families and neighbourhoods,  those with a parent who had a health service contact for a mental disorder, and  more recent birth cohorts. Risk was reduced amongst children of immigrants  compared to children of non-migrants. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study  provide important information for health service planning in South-Western BC.  Future work should examine whether variations in diagnosed incidence is driven by  differences in health service engagement or reflect genuine differences in risk.",Apr-22,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,295-304,,4,67,,Can J Psychiatry,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 34792422  PMCID: PMC9014684,,,,Humans; Adult; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Retrospective Studies; Child; Adolescent; Young Adult; Cohort Studies; Incidence; psychosis; refugee; British Columbia/epidemiology; health disparities; adolescence; *Psychotic Disorders/epidemiology; early-onset schizophrenia; immigrant mental health; income inequality; schizophrenia; sex,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS:  Using the municipality refugee database as the sampling frame, 80 clusters of 50  people (aged 2+ years) were selected using probability proportionate to size  sampling of clusters and random selection of households within clusters.  Disability assessment included: i) self-reported difficulties in functioning  (using the Washington Group Short Set-Enhanced tool and Child Functioning  Modules), ii) Rapid Assessment of Musculoskeletal Impairment and iii) screening  for symptoms of common mental disorders for children aged 8-17. RESULTS: The  overall prevalence of disability was 24.7% (95% CI 22.1-27.4), when including  people self-reporting a lot of difficulty/cannot do in at least functional domain  (15%, 95% CI 13.1-17.2), moderate/severe MSI (8.7%, 95% CI 7.6-9.9), and/or  symptomatic anxiety, depression and PTSD among children 8-17 (21.0%, 95% CI  18.2-23.9).

The main objective of  UNRWA's family planning programme is to promote the health of mothers, children,  and their families. The aim of this follow-up study was to assess contraceptive  practices in the target population 5 years after the 2010 follow-up study and to  identify future programme needs. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was a done  by trained nurses from June 1 to Dec 31, 2015. Participants were Palestinian  refugee mothers who attended Well Baby Clinics at all UNRWA health centres with  their youngest child (aged 2 months to 5 years). A sample size of 10 478  participants was calculated on the basis of contraceptive use in 2010, using Epi  Info sample size calculation. Women were interviewed, and retrospective data from  health records were used as supplementary data. We did a multiple logistic  regression to test if maternal age and parity predicted contraceptive use. We  used the χ(2) test to analyse the relation between previous contraceptive use and  birth interval, birth weight, and gestational age. All participants provided  verbal informed consent. The study was approved by the ethical committee in the  UNRWA Health Department. FINDINGS: Data were obtained from 9860 mothers (mean age  29·8 years [range 29·4-30·1]). 5849 (59%) women were using modern contraceptives  at the time of the survey, 1745 (18%) were using traditional methods, and 2265  (23%) were not using any contraceptive method. The most common modern  contraceptive was an intrauterine device (2186 [37%] women), and UNRWA was the  main provider for 4827 (83%) women using modern contraceptives. The most common  reasons for not using contraceptives were a wish to have a child (873 [22%]  women), pregnancy (747 [19%]), and a husband's opposition (775 [20%]). Using  women with less than three pregnancies as the reference category, use of  contraceptives was most likely in women with three to six pregnancies (adjusted  odds ratio 1·58, 95% 1·43-1·73; p<0·0001) and in women with more than six  pregnancies (1·6, 1·28-1·99; p<0·0001). Women with at least one male child were  more likely to use contraceptives than women with no male child (1·39, 1·24-1·56;  p<0·0001). Maternal age over 35 years was not a significant predictor for modern  contraceptive use. We found a statistically significant correlation between  previous contraceptive use and birthweight [c(2)=23·88; p<0·0001)] but not with  gestational age. INTERPRETATION: It is encouraging that mothers seeking modern  contraceptives rely on UNRWA to provide family planning services. We found that  mothers with higher parity are more likely to use modern contraceptives that  comply with UNRWA recommendations. As expected, modern contraceptives lead to  better birth spacing. However, mothers above 35 years of age are not more likely  to use modern contraceptives, and these mothers might be at higher risk for  negative maternal and infant health outcomes. UNRWA family planning services  could focus more on counselling this group of mothers.

This study evaluates the longer-term impact of a brief, lay provider delivered  group psychological intervention (Group Problem Management Plus; gPM+) on the  mental health of refugees and their children's mental health. METHODS: This  single-blind, parallel, controlled trial randomised 410 adult Syrians in Azraq  Refugee Camp in Jordan who screened positive for distress and impaired  functioning to either five sessions of gPM+ or enhanced usual care (EUC). Primary  outcomes were scores on the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25; depression and  anxiety scales) assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months and 12 months Secondary  outcomes included disability, posttraumatic stress, personally identified  problems, prolonged grief, prodromal psychotic symptoms, parenting behaviour and  children's mental health. RESULTS: Between 15 October 2019 and 2 March 2020, 204  participants were assigned to gPM + and 206 to EUC, and 307 (74.9%) were retained  at 12 months. Intent-to-treat analyses indicated that although participants in  gPM + had greater reductions in depression at 3 months, at 12 months there were  no significant differences between treatment arms on depression (mean difference  -0.9, 95% CI -3.2 to 1.3; p = 0.39) or anxiety (mean difference -1.7, 95% CI -4.8  to -1.3; p = 0.06). There were no significant differences between conditions for  secondary outcomes except that participants in gPM + had greater increases in  positive parenting.

Exposure to violence and mental health problems such as posttraumatic stress  disorder are frequently reported among migrant children, but there is a knowledge  gap in our understanding of the complex longitudinal interplay between  individual, social and societal risk and resilience factors that impact mental  health and well-being, quality of life and ability to function and adapt. There  is also an urgent societal need to facilitate interdisciplinary and intersectoral  collaborative efforts to develop effective methods to prevent, detect and respond  to the needs of the migrants. This project will study adolescent and young adult  migrants in Sweden using multiple methods such as quantitative analysis of data  from a prospective cohort study and qualitative analysis of data gathered from  teller-focused interviews. The aim is to understand how different factors impact  mental health and integration into the Swedish society. Furthermore, individual  experiences related to the migration process and exposure to violence will be  studied in detail. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Study participants will include 490  migrants aged 12-25 years recruited through social services, healthcare, social  media and the civil society. A subsample of adolescents (n=160) will be  re-interviewed after 1 year. Data are collected using structured and  semi-structured interviews along with saliva and hair sampling.

Materials and Methods: In this community-based  participatory research study, we surveyed adult family members of teens aged  11-17 years from African American, African refugee, American Indian/Alaskan  Native, Hispanic/Latino, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander community groups in  Salt Lake City, Utah. Bivariate analyses assessed associations between  sociodemographic characteristics and, respectively, HPV vaccine receipt and  intentions for vaccination. Barriers to vaccination were also investigated.  Results: Only 20% of participants had vaccinated at least one of their children  with at least one dose of the HPV vaccine. HPV vaccination was significantly  related to caregiver age (p=0.035), race/ethnicity (p=0.001), educational  attainment (p=0.006), annual household income (p=0.0454), years in the United  States (p=0.023), and caregiver parent birthplace (p=0.008).

Aims: To evaluate public and individual  health benefits of stool screening, and explore whether importation of enteric  pathogens by newly-arrived asylum seekers impacts on the host population.  Methods: We used data from mandatory stool screening to determine the overall,  age, sex, and country-specific prevalence of enteric bacteria and helminths. We  used surveillance data to assess whether the number of incoming asylum seekers  influenced notifications of salmonellosis and shigellosis in  Rhineland-Palatinate. Results: Salmonella were found in 0.2% (95% confidence  interval (CI) 0.2-0.3%) of 23,410 samples collected from January 2015 to May  2016. Prevalence was highest in children under 5 years (0.8%; 95% CI: 0.5-1.3%).  No Shigella or invasive Salmonella spp. were detected. In a subset of 14,511  samples, the prevalence of helminth infestation was 2.4% (95% CI: 2.1-2.6%), with  highest proportions detected in adolescents (4.6%; 95% CI 3.8-5.4%) and among  Eritreans (9.3%; 95% CI: 7.0-12.0%); in the latter particularly Schistosoma  mansoni and Taenia spp. The increase in asylum applications did not increase  notifications of salmonellosis and shigellosis. No transmission from asylum  seekers to German residents was notified. Conclusion: Public health risk  associated with imported enteric pathogens is very low overall.

Earlier studies have highlighted the effectiveness of the  trauma-focused preventive group intervention ""Mein Weg"" (English ""My Way""), and  the feasibility of trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) for UYRs.  Both interventions are deemed to be empirically supported treatments (ESTs).  However, UYRs seldom receive ESTs or, in fact, any treatment at all. In view of  the high need and the limited treatment resources available, a stepped-care  approach is indicated but has not been evaluated so far. The purpose of this  trial is to compare the stepped-care approach BETTER CARE with usual care  enhanced with screening and indication (usual care+). METHODS: In a cluster  randomized controlled trial involving N = 540 UYRs living in up to N = 54 child  and youth welfare service (CYWS) facilities, BETTER CARE will be compared with  usual care+. We will randomize clusters comprising a CYWS facility with at least  one eligible psychotherapist. BETTER CARE consists of step (1) screening and  indication and either step (2) preventive trauma-focused group intervention ""Mein  Weg"" delivered by trained CYWS staff or step (3) TF-CBT delivered by trained  community therapists and supported by trained translators if necessary.  Participants will be assessed 6 and 12 months after randomization. The primary  outcome is the severity of PTSS after 12 months. Secondary outcomes are  depressive and anxiety symptoms, quality of life, and proxy reported PTSS.  Furthermore, drug use, health costs, benefits, and long-term effects on  integration/acculturation will be assessed. DISCUSSION: The trial will directly  integrate a stepped-care approach into existing structures of the German child  welfare and (mental) health system. It could, therefore, serve as a blueprint for  how to implement ESTs for UYRs. If successful, screening, prevention, and  intervention will be sustainably implemented in CYWS in southern Germany.

In March 2015, Community Partners  International, the Women's Refugee Commission, and four community-based  organisations (CBOs) assessed community-based sexual and reproductive health  (SRH) services in eastern Myanmar amidst the changing political contexts in  Myanmar and Thailand.

METHODS:  Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted with 25 women  recruited through a diverse community in Melbourne, Australia (November  2017-February 2018). Discussions explored pregnancy planning, preconception  health awareness, experiences and information needs. Qualitative data was  analysed iteratively, through content and thematic analysis.

Women had limited understanding  of the concept or importance of preconception health, limited access to  preconception health information and most women with children had experienced at  least one unplanned pregnancy. Cultural mores constrained community discussion of  preconception health in the context of sexual and reproductive health. Social  factors emerged as predominant preconception concerns. Women reported wanting  more information on preconception health through multiple, broad-reaching  avenues, paired with timely, sensitive healthcare engagement. CONCLUSION:  Information for women addressing preconception health and pregnancy planning is  limited. Our study demonstrates additional cultural and social nuances that need  to be understood when working with migrant women. Discomfort raising reproductive  and preconception health discussions with healthcare providers was a reported  concern. Integration of culturally-sensitive preconception care within routine  client assessments warrants exploration. Emphasis of the importance of  preconception care for all women is needed.",Jul-20,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,334-342,,4,33,,Women Birth,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2019 Australian College of Midwives.

This world-wide crisis of  displacement reflects people seeking safety across borders and oceans; dangerous  journeys that compound the trauma endured by these women, men and children.  Refugees/asylum seekers face barriers upon entry to the U.S. The Western New York  Center for Survivors (WNYCST) provides care coordination/trauma-informed care to  mitigate these challenges. The objective of this study was to explore the  resettlement experiences of survivors of torture living in Western New York, who  had received services from the WNYCST; identifying challenges, unmet needs, and  services that were helpful. Secondarily, we describe the experiences of asylum  seekers and legally resettled refugees, who due to their differing legal status,  might be expected to have different experiences. Data were collected using  semi-structured qualitative interviews. RESULTS: Three themes emerged: mental  health challenges, relating to their experiences in their home country and their  separation from family; unmet needs, including lack of a sense of purpose and  meaning, difficulty navigating services, and missing connections to community;  and coping strategies, including WNYCST assistance with connecting with sources  of social support in their new community. WNYCST services were helpful,  particularly the assistance and connection with care coordinators and local  support groups. This care and outreach helped to mitigate feelings of separation  and apartness from their home countries and families. CONCLUSIONS: Some  refugees/asylum seekers continue to struggle with unmet needs, issues of loss and  isolation. If care providers recognize signs of stress early, appropriate  interventions can be implemented. Care connections and trauma informed treatment  with an emphasis on recreating ties with communities, may be one important factor  in ensuring successful integration.",2021-03-09,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,27,,1,17,,Global Health,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 33750402  PMCID: PMC7941991,,,,Humans; Female; Male; Child; Social Support; Mental Health; Mental health; *Refugees; Refugees; *Torture; Resettlement; Asylum seekers; Torture; Survivors; Trauma informed care,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bhutanese refugees aged 18 years or older were recruited for eight focus group  discussions, organized by age and gender ( N = 67, 49.3% female, mean age = 38,  SD = 15.9). The PEN-3 cultural model was used as the theoretical framework to  examine the roles of cultural perceptions that influence mental health-seeking  behaviors. Focus group discussions were audio taped to facilitate the  thematic-analysis. Younger participants (<35 years) reported experiencing  stressors relating to economic hardships and difficulties in developing academic  and social skills as they juggle breadwinner and care-giving responsibilities for  their families. Older participants reported frustration with the difficulties in  learning English and increased dependence on their children. Family members  provided the initial frontline support to persons with mental health problems. If  family support did not work, they consulted with their relatives and trustworthy  community members for further assistance. Psychological factors such as fears of  emotions, social norms, beliefs, and self-esteem associated with cultural norms  and values influenced seeking mental health support. All participants expressed  the need to have a culturally tailored intervention to develop acquired skills to  improve their self-esteem and self-efficacy in order to integrate into their new  social and cultural environment.

This study aimed at investigating the spectrum of vision impairment  and other ocular conditions in refugees utilising the Victorian Eyecare Service  operated by the Australian College of Optometry. METHODS: A cross-sectional study  of electronic clinical records of 518 individuals (adults and children)  recognised as refugees by the Australian College of Optometry and treated between  January 2013 and May 2014 were identified. Extracted data included presenting  visual acuities, best-corrected visual acuities, and final refraction values  (using spherical equivalents), for both eyes. Diagnoses of presenting ocular  conditions were also extracted. RESULTS: Of all refugees examined, 129 (27.2 per  cent) had some degree of vision impairment (≤ 6/9.5) based on presenting visual  acuities in their better eye; five (1.0 per cent) being of a severe (≤ 6/60) or  profound (≤ 6/120) nature.

Since  its ratification, the European Convention on Human Rights was made binding in all  Member States of the Council of Europe and is interpreted by the European Court  of Human Rights (ECtHR). Despite its legal recognition, discrimination in  healthcare provision has repeatedly been an issue of medicoethical and political  consideration. In this context, minors are particularly in danger of being  deprived of this fundamental right. The aim of this study is to analyze the  current state of the ECtHR jurisdiction on challenges in accessing healthcare for  minor patients. We conducted a systematic search of judgments by the ECtHR using  the keywords ""healthcare"" and ""child"". We performed descriptive statistics and  qualitative thematic analysis. Our search resulted in n = 66 judgments, which  were all screened. Access to healthcare for minors played a role in n = 21  judgments, which involved applications against n = 13 countries. We formed five,  partially overlapping categories, which represent recurring themes regarding the  research topic. These themes are governance failure (n = 11), the status of  refugee, asylum seeker or migrant (n = 5), parental home (n = 5), maternity and  birth (n = 4) and others (n = 2). The normative framework of the ECtHR's  jurisprudence illustrates intersections between social, legal and medicoethical  aspects of minors' discrimination in the healthcare system. It emphasizes the  particular vulnerability of children, who require exceptional protection.  Inadequate access to healthcare manifests itself in specific situations, such as  in the context of migration or staying in public institutions.

We conducted enhanced TB surveillance to  collect supplementary information on TB cases among recent immigrants and their  children to provide data for revising TB control policies in Finland to take into  account the decrease in native cases and increase in foreign-born cases. METHODS:  TB cases were identified from the National Infectious Diseases Register. Data on  foreign-born (if not available, most recent nationality other than Finnish) TB  cases notified during 2014-2016 (country of birth, date of arrival to Finland,  participation in TB screening, date of first symptoms, and details of possible  contact tracing) were requested from physicians responsible for regional  communicable disease control through a web-based questionnaire. RESULTS:  Questionnaires were returned for 203 (65%) of 314 foreign-born TB cases; 36 (18%)  were paediatric cases TB was detected in arrival screening in 42 (21%) and during  contact tracing of another TB case in 18 (9%); 143 (70%) cases sought care for  symptoms or were identified by chance (e.g. chest x-ray because of an accident).  Of cases with data available, 48 (24%) cases were diagnosed within 3 months of  arrival to Finland, 55 (27%) cases between 3 months and 2 years from arrival, and  84 (42%) cases after 2 years from arrival. Of all the foreign-born cases, 17% had  been in a reception centre in Finland and 15% had been in a refugee camp abroad.  CONCLUSIONS: In addition to asylum seekers and refugees, TB screening should be  considered for immigrants arriving from high TB incidence countries, since the  majority of TB cases were detected among persons who immigrated to Finland due to  other reasons, presumably work or study.

DESIGN:  Cross-sectional, mixed-methods study. SETTING: Two home visits were conducted  with families 10days apart with a 7-day observational period between home visits.  PARTICIPANTS: Children (n = 150) aged 5-7years and their families from 1 of 6  racial and ethnic or immigrant and refugee groups, including African American,  Hispanic, Hmong, Native American, Somali, and white, participated in the Family  Matters study between 2014 and 2016.

ANALYSIS:  Adjusted logistic and linear regression models with robust SEs were used in  analysis. RESULTS: Higher family functioning scores across the majority of family  dyads were significantly associated with lower child weight status (P < .05). In  addition, some family functioning scores were associated with child diet and  physical activity, but not consistently. Parenting behavior scores were  inconsistently associated with child weight and weight-related outcomes.  CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Results suggest that the interactive family board  game task is a direct observational approach that researchers can use with family  members to measure family functioning and parenting behaviors related to  childhood obesity.

We explored characteristics of flags as well as changes in  survey-level MUAC-for-age z-score (MUACZ) and MUAC means, SD and percentage of  flags based on three flagging approaches: ±3 and ±4 MUACZ z-scores from observed  MUACZ survey mean and a fixed interval 100-200 mm of MUAC.

These attacks included the burning of homes  and farms, beatings, shootings, sexual violence, summary executions, burying the  dead in mass graves, and other atrocities. The Myanmar government has denied any  responsibility. To document evidence of reported atrocities and identify  patterns, we interviewed survivors, documented physical injuries, and assessed  for consistency in their reports. METHODS: We use purposive and snowball sampling  to identify survivors residing in refugee camps in Bangladesh. Interviews and  examinations were conducted by trained investigators with the assistance of  interpreters based on the Istanbul Protocol - the international standard to  investigate and document instances of torture and other cruel, inhuman, and  degrading treatment. The goal was to assess whether the clinical findings  corroborate survivors' narratives and to identify emblematic patterns. RESULTS:  During four separate field visits between December 2017 and July 2018, we  interviewed and where relevant, conducted physical examinations on a total of 114  refugees. The participants came from 36 villages in Northern Rakhine state; 36  (32%) were female, 26 (23%) were children. Testimonies described several patterns  in the violence prior to their flight, including the organization of the attacks,  the involvement of non-Rohingya civilians, the targeted and purposeful  destruction of homes and eviction of Rohingya residents, and the denial of  medical care. Physical findings included injuries from gunshots, blunt trauma,  penetrating trauma such as slashings and mutilations, burns, and explosives and  from sexual and gender-based violence. CONCLUSIONS: While each survivor's  experience was unique, similarities in the types and organization of attacks  support allegations of a systematic, widespread, and premeditated campaign of  forced displacement and violence. Physical findings were consistent with  survivors' narratives of violence and brutality. These findings warrant  accountability for the Myanmar military per the Rome Statute of the International  Criminal Court (ICC), which has jurisdiction to try individuals for serious  international crimes, including crimes against humanity and genocide. Legal  accountability for these crimes should be pursued along with medical and  psychological care and rehabilitation to address the ongoing effects of violence,  discrimination, and displacement.",2019,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,42,,,13,,Confl Health,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 31534473  PMCID: PMC6745767,,,,Myanmar; Injuries; Refugees; Rohingya; Bangladesh; Rakhine; Survivors; Crimes against humanity; Genocide; Istanbul protocol; Mass atrocities; Medico-legal evaluations; Physical evaluations; Scars,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SIV holders (SIVH) are applicants who were employed  by, or on behalf of, the US government or the US military. There is limited  information about health conditions in SIV populations to help guide US  clinicians caring for SIVH. Thus, we sought to describe health characteristics of  recently arrived SIVH from Iraq and Afghanistan who were seen for domestic  medical examinations. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This cross-sectional analysis  included data from Iraqi and Afghan SIVH who received a domestic medical  examination from January 2014 to December 2016. Data were gathered from state  refugee health programs in seven states (California, Colorado, Illinois,  Kentucky, Minnesota, New York, and Texas), one county, and one academic medical  center and included 6,124 adults and 4,814 children. Data were collected for  communicable diseases commonly screened for during the exam, including  tuberculosis (TB), hepatitis B, hepatitis C, malaria, strongyloidiasis,  schistosomiasis, other intestinal parasites, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and  human immunodeficiency virus, as well as elevated blood lead levels (EBLL). We  investigated the frequency and proportion of diseases and whether there were any  differences in selected disease prevalence in SIVH from Iraq compared to SIVH  from Afghanistan. A majority of SIV adults were male (Iraqi 54.0%, Afghan 58.6%)  and aged 18-44 (Iraqi 86.0%, Afghan 97.7%). More SIV children were male (Iraqi  56.2%, Afghan 52.2%) and aged 6-17 (Iraqi 50.2%, Afghan 40.7%). The average age  of adults was 29.7 years, and the average age for children was 5.6 years. Among  SIV adults, 14.4% were diagnosed with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), 63.5%  were susceptible to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, and 31.0% had at least one  intestinal parasite. Afghan adults were more likely to have LTBI (prevalence  ratio [PR]: 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-2.7) and to be infected with  HBV (PR: 4.6; 95% CI 3.6-6.0) than Iraqi adults. Among SIV children, 26.7% were  susceptible to HBV infection, 22.1% had at least one intestinal parasite, and  50.1% had EBLL (≥5 mcg/dL). Afghan children were more likely to have a pathogenic  intestinal parasite (PR: 2.7; 95% CI 2.4-3.2) and EBLL (PR: 2.0; 95% CI 1.5-2.5)  than Iraqi children. Limitations of the analysis included lack of uniform health  screening data collection across all nine sites and possible misclassification by  clinicians of Iraqi and Afghan SIVH as Iraqi and Afghan refugees, respectively.  CONCLUSION: In this analysis, we observed that 14% of SIV adults had LTBI, 27% of  SIVH had at least one intestinal parasite, and about half of SIV children had  EBLL. Most adults were susceptible to HBV. In general, prevalence of infection  was higher for most conditions among Afghan SIVH compared to Iraqi SIVH. The  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Guidelines for the US Domestic  Medical Examination for Newly Arriving Refugees can assist state public health  departments and clinicians in the care of SIVH during the domestic medical  examination. Future analyses can explore other aspects of health among resettled  SIV populations, including noncommunicable diseases and vaccination coverage.",Mar-20,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,e1003083,,3,17,,PLoS Med,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 32231361  PMCID: PMC7108690,,,,"Humans; Adult; Female; United States; Cross-Sectional Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Aged; Child; Adolescent; Young Adult; Emigrants and Immigrants/*statistics & numerical data; Infant, Newborn; Iraq/ethnology; Child, Preschool; Infant; Refugees/*statistics & numerical data; Afghanistan/ethnology; *Health Status; *Mass Screening",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Young children are  highly vulnerable because of rapid growth and inadequate dietary practices.  Multiple micronutrient powders (MNPs) are single-dose packets containing multiple  vitamins and minerals in powder form, which are mixed into any semi-solid food  for children six months of age or older. The use of MNPs for home or point-of-use  fortification of complementary foods has been proposed as an intervention for  improving micronutrient intake in children under two years of age. In 2014, MNP  interventions were implemented in 43 countries and reached over three million  children. This review updates a previous Cochrane Review, which has become  out-of-date. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects and safety of home (point-of-use)  fortification of foods with MNPs on nutrition, health, and developmental outcomes  in children under two years of age. For the purposes of this review, home  fortification with MNP refers to the addition of powders containing vitamins and  minerals to semi-solid foods immediately before consumption. This can be done at  home or at any other place that meals are consumed (e.g. schools, refugee camps).  For this reason, MNPs are also referred to as point-of-use fortification. SEARCH  METHODS: We searched the following databases up to July 2019: CENTRAL, MEDLINE,  Embase, and eight other databases. We also searched four trials registers,  contacted relevant organisations and authors of included studies to identify any  ongoing or unpublished studies, and searched the reference lists of included  studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and  quasi-RCTs with individual randomisation or cluster-randomisation. Participants  were infants and young children aged 6 to 23 months at the time of intervention,  with no identified specific health problems. The intervention consisted of  consumption of food fortified at the point of use with MNP formulated with at  least iron, zinc, and vitamin A, compared with placebo, no intervention, or use  of iron-containing supplements, which is standard practice. DATA COLLECTION AND  ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies  against the inclusion criteria, extracted data from included studies, and  assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We reported categorical outcomes  as risk ratios (RRs) or odds ratios (ORs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs),  and continuous outcomes as mean differences (MDs) and 95% CIs. We used the GRADE  approach to assess the certainty of evidence. MAIN RESULTS: We included 29  studies (33,147 children) conducted in low- and middle-income countries in Asia,  Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean, where anaemia is a public health  problem. Twenty-six studies with 27,051 children contributed data. The  interventions lasted between 2 and 44 months, and the powder formulations  contained between 5 and 22 nutrients. Among the 26 studies contributing data, 24  studies (26,486 children) compared the use of MNP versus no intervention or  placebo; the two remaining studies compared the use of MNP versus an iron-only  supplement (iron drops) given daily. The main outcomes of interest were related  to anaemia and iron status. We assessed most of the included studies at low risk  of selection and attrition bias. We considered some studies to be at high risk of  performance and detection bias due to lack of blinding. Most studies were funded  by government programmes or foundations; only two were funded by industry. Home  fortification with MNP, compared with no intervention or placebo, reduced the  risk of anaemia in infants and young children by 18% (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.76 to  0.90; 16 studies; 9927 children; moderate-certainty evidence) and iron deficiency  by 53% (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.56; 7 studies; 1634 children; high-certainty  evidence). Children receiving MNP had higher haemoglobin concentrations (MD 2.74  g/L, 95% CI 1.95 to 3.53; 20 studies; 10,509 children; low-certainty evidence)  and higher iron status (MD 12.93 μg/L, 95% CI 7.41 to 18.45; 7 studies; 2612  children; moderate-certainty evidence) at follow-up compared with children  receiving the control intervention. We did not find an effect on weight-for-age  (MD 0.02, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.07; 10 studies; 9287 children; moderate-certainty  evidence). Few studies reported morbidity outcomes (three to five studies each  outcome) and definitions varied, but MNP did not increase diarrhoea, upper  respiratory infection, malaria, or all-cause morbidity. In comparison with daily  iron supplementation, the use of MNP produced similar results for anaemia (RR  0.89, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.39; 1 study; 145 children; low-certainty evidence) and  haemoglobin concentrations (MD -2.81 g/L, 95% CI -10.84 to 5.22; 2 studies; 278  children; very low-certainty evidence) but less diarrhoea (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.38  to 0.72; 1 study; 262 children; low-certainty of evidence). However, given the  limited quantity of data, these results should be interpreted cautiously.  Reporting of death was infrequent, although no trials reported deaths  attributable to the intervention. Information on side effects and morbidity,  including malaria and diarrhoea, was scarce. It appears that use of MNP is  efficacious among infants and young children aged 6 to 23 months who are living  in settings with different prevalences of anaemia and malaria endemicity,  regardless of intervention duration. MNP intake adherence was variable and in  some cases comparable to that achieved in infants and young children receiving  standard iron supplements as drops or syrups. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Home  fortification of foods with MNP is an effective intervention for reducing anaemia  and iron deficiency in children younger than two years of age. Providing MNP is  better than providing no intervention or placebo and may be comparable to using  daily iron supplementation. The benefits of this intervention as a child survival  strategy or for developmental outcomes are unclear. Further investigation of  morbidity outcomes, including malaria and diarrhoea, is needed. MNP intake  adherence was variable and in some cases comparable to that achieved in infants  and young children receiving standard iron supplements as drops or syrups.",2020-02-28,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,CD008959,,2,2,,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,,,,,,,,eng,"Copyright © 2020 The Cochrane Collaboration.

This study evaluates the impact of a brief, lay provider delivered group-based  psychological intervention [Group Problem Management Plus (gPM+)] on the mental  health of refugees in a camp, as well as on parenting behavior and children's  mental health. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this single-blind, parallel, randomized  controlled trial, 410 adult Syrian refugees (300 females, 110 males) in Azraq  Refugee Camp (Jordan) were identified through screening of psychological distress  (≥16 on the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale) and impaired functioning (≥17  on the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule). Participants were randomly allocated  to gPM+ or enhanced usual care (EUC) involving referral information for  psychosocial services on a 1:1 ratio. Participants were aware of treatment  allocation, but assessors were blinded to treatment condition. Primary outcomes  were scores on the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL; depression and anxiety  scales) assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, and 3 months follow-up as the primary  outcome time point. It was hypothesized that gPM+ would result in greater  reductions of scores on the HSCL than EUC. Secondary outcomes were disability,  posttraumatic stress, personally identified problems, prolonged grief, prodromal  psychotic symptoms, parenting behavior, and children's mental health. Between  October 15, 2019 and March 2, 2020, 624 refugees were screened for eligibility,  462 (74.0%) screened positive, of whom 204 were assigned to gPM+ and 206 to EUC.  There were 168 (82.4%) participants in gPM+ and 189 (91.7%) in EUC assessed at  follow-up. Intent-to-treat analyses indicated that at follow-up, participants in  gPM+ showed greater reduction on HSCL depression scale than those receiving EUC  (mean difference, 3.69 [95% CI 1.90 to 5.48], p = .001; effect size, 0.40). There  was no difference between conditions in anxiety (mean difference -0.56, 95% CI  -2.09 to 0.96; p = .47; effect size, -0.03). Relative to EUC, participants in  gPM+ had greater reductions in severity of personally identified problems (mean  difference 0.88, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.69; p = .03), and inconsistent disciplinary  parenting (mean difference 1.54, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.05; p < .001). There were no  significant differences between conditions for changes in PTSD, disability,  grief, prodromal symptoms, or childhood mental health outcomes. Mediation  analysis indicated the change in inconsistent disciplinary parenting was  associated with reduced attentional (β = 0.11, SE .07; 95% CI .003 to .274) and  internalizing (β = 0.08, SE .05; 95% CI .003 to 0.19) problems in children. No  adverse events were attributable to the interventions or the trial. Major  limitations included only one-quarter of participants being male, and measures of  personally identified problems, grief, prodromal psychotic symptoms, inconsistent  parenting behavior, and children's mental health have not been validated with  Syrians. CONCLUSIONS: In camp-based Syrian refugees, a brief group behavioral  intervention led to reduced depressive symptoms, personally identified problems,  and disciplinary parenting compared to usual care, and this may have indirect  benefits for refugees' children. The limited capacity of the intervention to  reduce PTSD, disability, or children's psychological problems points to the need  for development of more effective treatments for refugees in camp settings.

The most common primary outcome of WASH trials is carer-reported diarrhoea. We  evaluate different diarrhoea survey instruments as proxy markers of enteric  pathogen presence in stool. METHODS: We recruited 800 community-based  participants from the Cox's Bazar Displaced Person's Camp in Bangladesh, split  evenly between the rainy (July/August 2020) and dry (November/December 2020)  periods. Participants were randomized evenly into either a standard survey asking  carers if their child under five years old has had diarrhoea in the past  fortnight, or a pictorial survey asking carers to pick from a pictorial chart  which stools their child under five years old has had in the past fortnight. We  collected stools from a random sub-sample of 120. Stools were examined visually,  and tested for proteins associated with enteric infection and 16 enteric  pathogens. We calculated sensitivities and specificities for each survey type,  visual examination, and proteins with respect to enteric pathogen presence.  FINDINGS: The sensitivity of the standard survey for enteric pathogen presence  was 0.49[95%CI:0.32,0.66] and the specificity was 0.65[0.41,0.85]. Similar  sensitivities and specificities were observed for pictorial survey, visual  inspection, and proteins. INTERPRETATION: While diarrhoea is an important sign in  clinical practice it appears that it is a poor proxy for enteric pathogen  presence in stool in epidemiological surveys. When enteric infection is of  interest, this should be measured directly.

We examined in this study differences in the use of medicines among  different age and sex groups of the study participants. SETTING: Fifteen  different refugee shared accommodation centres in the greater Cologne area, a  community centre with a language school and consultation office, and other places  frequented by the Syrian community. PARTICIPANTS: Syrian AS&Rs registered in NRW  and residing in the city of Cologne or surrounding areas. PRIMARY OUTCOME  MEASURES: The prevalence of using at least one medicine in the 7 days preceding  data collection, and the use of prescribed medicines and self-medication.  RESULTS: Of the 1641 Syrian AS&Rs who took part in our study, the overall 7-day  prevalence of medicine use was 34.9%. Among adults, headache and hypertension  were the most common indications that led to medicine use. By dose, hypertension  (954 doses) and diabetes (595 doses) were the first and second most frequent  indication. Among children, fever and cough were the most common indication;  ibuprofen and hederae helicis folium preparations were the most used medicines.  Low prevalence was found of medicine use for the treatment of either infectious  diseases or mental disorders. CONCLUSION: Among the Syrian AS&Rs in NRW who  participated in the study, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) were common presumed  causes of use of medication among adults.

In this context, both women and men have rights. In this study, it is  aimed to reveal the obstacles in using these rights and to describe perceptions  on marriage and family planning (FP) of Syrian women and men and to increase  awareness for developing new policies on the Primary Health Care. METHODS: The  study was conducted using qualitative method, consisting of in-depth interviews  with 54 participants; 43 women and 11 men who had to emigrate from varied regions  of Syria at different times since 2011. Syrian women living in Hatay, in the  south of Turkey were identified from Primary Health Care Center. Most of the  Syrian women had given birth to the first two children before the age of 20  years. The interviewees were selected by purposive and snowball sampling.  RESULTS: The result was examined under seven headings: knowledge about FP and  contraceptive methods, hesitation about contraceptive methods, emotional pressure  of family and fear of maintaining marriage, embarrassing of talking about  sexuality and contraception, the effects of belief and culture on contraception,  psychological reflections of war, and changes in the perception of health during  the process of immigration. The most significant factors affecting the approaches  to FP and contraceptive methods of the women in this study were determined to be  education, traditions, economic status, and religious beliefs. The most important  factors affecting participants' FP and contraceptive method approaches are  education, cultural beliefs, economic status, and religious beliefs. CONCLUSIONS:  The primary healthcare centers are at a very strategical point for offering FP  services to help address patients' unmet contraceptive needs and improve  pregnancy outcomes.More attention should be paid to social determinants that  influence the access to reproductive health.

Our  aim is to compare the incidence of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) between  Syrian refugees and Turkish citizens. METHODS: This multicenter, retrospective  study was conducted in Gaziantep University, Faculty of Medicine and Gaziantep  Children's Hospital in Turkey. We included the data of patients who were screened  for ROP between July 2015 and June 2017. RESULTS: The above-mentioned data of 906  Turkish infants and 199 Syrian infants were included in this study. Mean  gestational ages (GAs) were (32.9 ± 2.7) and (32.1 ± 2.8) weeks as well as mean  birth weights (BWs) were (1937.5 ± 582.9) and (1696.8 ± 485.5) g, in Turkish and  Syrian infants, respectively. GA and BW were significantly lower in Syrian  infants while time spent in neonatal intensive care unit was significantly  higher. The zone of ROP was lower in the Syrian infants in the first examination  and for the most advanced ROP (P = 0.001). Any stage ROP was present in 392  (43.3%) and 81 (40.7%) patients in Turkish and Syrian population, respectively (P  = 0.490). The number of patients who required treatment for ROP were 95 (10.5%)  and 20 (10.1%) in Turkish and Syrian groups, respectively (P = 0.882).  CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that refugee infants had lower BW and GA than  native population but the incidence of ROP did not differ between them.

In recent years, WRBI has had a tremendous  harmful impact on the pediatric population. This study aimed to investigate the  demographics, causes, mechanisms of burns, surgical procedures, the major and  minor risk factors affecting mortality, and outcomes of pediatric WRBI amidst the  Syrian refugees and the Turkey neighborhood population, treated at our Burn  Center. METHODS: Out of the 852 filled records, the retrospective cohort was  performed with inclusion of 707 pediatric burn patients, 469 Turkey, and 238  Syrian participants, with age 0-17 years. Included in the study were patients  admitted to our institution from December 2013 to May 2016, with at least 12  months of consistent follow-up. Independent variables of each patient collected  data included age, gender, weight, ethnicity, locations patients coming from,  season and reason of burn, type of burn, grade of burn, burnt body regions, total  body surface area (TBSA), body surface area (BSA), burnt surface area (BuSA),  time delay until admission, and presence of infection at time of admission. The  dependent variables were hospitalization periods, surgical procedures of  escharotomy, fasciotomy, and grafting, recorded final patient status, and  mortality. RESULTS: Syrian children with WRBI (direct-blastic,  indirect-unintentional) suffered from higher BSA (mean=0.91m(2), p=0.001) than  the Turkish children with non-intentional burns (0.89m(2), p=0.001), P=0.001.  There was a significant relationship between causes of burns, such as hot  liquids, fire/flames and blastic injuries among the Syrian (52.9%, 27.3%,  p=0.000) and the Turkish (86.4%, 7.6% P=0.000) populations, respectively.  Although most of the Turkey residents suffered more from hot liquid burns than  the Syrians (86.4% vs 52.9%), the majority of mortality occurred with fire/flames  and blastic injuries, which was higher among the Syrians (10.10%, p=0.001) than  the Turkish (2.80% p=0.001). Mortality corresponded with complex and third-degree  burns, ranking higher in the Syrian (100%) than in the Turkish (23.3%), which, in  turn, related to hospital length of stay (Syrian mean: 9.79, p=0.001; Turkish  mean: 7.83, p=0.839). CONCLUSION: Our analysis showed that flame/fire and blast  burns were severe and fatal in more pediatric Syrian victims than the Turkey  residents due to the severity of war inflicted burned wounds, the living  conditions at the refugee camps, and the tent cities. Our present study is  significant as our data would alert authorities to predict pediatric WRBI risk  factors, burn survivals and casualties, and thus plan strategies to promote  training programs for burn management of two distinct populations to reduce risk  factors of burn mortality. Burnt surface area (BuSA) is a new parameter we  derived to predict mortality risk factors in WRBI.",Aug-18,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,1210-1227,,5,44,,Burns,,,,,,,,eng,Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI.

Accordingly, like other European countries, the Swiss government has  recently chosen to implement a specific resettlement program. This program is  characterized by the fact that the whole nuclear family is granted a work and  residence permit upon arrival, and benefits from enhanced integration services.  The aim of the present project is to evaluate the effects of the Swiss  resettlement program, with a special focus on mental health, while adopting a  family perspective. METHODS: The outcomes of 15 Syrian families taking part in  this program will be compared to those of 15 Syrian families that came to  Switzerland through other means (i.e., following the usual asylum procedure,  which is much more stressful and time consuming). Each family member above 8  years old will be invited to participate to a 3-wave longitudinal survey  concerning the resettlement process: upon arrival in the collective shelters, six  and 12 months later. Questionnaires will be used for the evaluation of  participants' mental health, risk behaviors, general health, romantic  relationship, parent-child relationship, family functioning, parentification,  social support, and social identities related to group belongingness. DISCUSSION:  The findings of the present project will provide longitudinal information on  Syrian refugees. A comprehensive approach will be adopted by screening potential  difficulties that the sample may be faced with and potential strengths that  participants may rely on. Accordingly, physical and mental health, as well as the  quality of family functioning, the feeling of support and of belongingness to  different groups will be evaluated. We will also compare the results of families  who had the chance to immigrate through the Swiss resettlement program, to the  results of families that did not. This comparison will allow the elaboration of  hypotheses regarding adjusted asylum policies. Furthermore, it will enhance our  knowledge regarding the impact of displacement on the family system. Indeed,  although the role of the family for the well-being of adults and children has  been established, surprisingly few studies have adopted this focus in the asylum  field.",2019-12-16,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,32,,1,19,,BMC Int Health Hum Rights,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: England PMID: 31842865  PMCID: PMC6916107,,,,"Humans; Adult; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Aged; Child; Adolescent; Young Adult; Syria/ethnology; Research Design; Child, Preschool; Social Support; Longitudinal Studies; Mental health; *Mental Health; Refugees/*psychology; *Health Services Needs and Demand; Syrian refugees; Family; Switzerland; Resettlement program",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: This article aimed to  describe a possible solution to address weak surveillance systems and document  the outcomes of the deployment of the Auto-Visual Acute Flaccid Paralysis  Detection and Reporting (AVADAR) project. METHODS: This intervention was  implemented in 99 targeted high-risk districts with concerns for silent polio  circulation from eight countries in Africa between August 1, 2017, and July 31,  2018. A total of 6954 persons (5390 community informants and 1564 health workers)  were trained and equipped with a smartphone on which the AVADAR app was  configured to allow community informants to send alerts on suspected acute  flaccid paralysis (AFP) and allow health worker to use electronic checklists for  investigation of such alerts. The AVADAR and Open Data Kit ONA servers were at  the center of the entire process. A dashboard system and coordination teams for  monitoring and supervision were put in place at all levels. RESULTS: Overall,  96.44% (24,142/25,032) of potential AFP case alerts were investigated by  surveillance personnel, yielding 1414 true AFP cases. This number (n=1414)  reported through AVADAR was higher than the 238 AFP cases expected during the  study period in the AVADAR districts and the 491 true AFP cases reported by the  traditional surveillance system. A total of 203 out of the 1414 true AFP cases  reported were from special population settings, such as refugee camps and  insecure areas. There was an improvement in reporting in silent health areas in  all the countries using the AVADAR system. Finally, there were 23,473 reports for  other diseases, such as measles, diarrhea, and cerebrospinal meningitis, using  the AVADAR platform.

These surveys have recorded a  decline from 127 per 1000 live births in 1960 to 20.2 in 2006. Thereafter, a  survey revealed an IMR of 22.4 in 2011. Alerted by these findings, a follow up  survey was conducted in 2015 to further assess the trend of IMR. METHODS: We used  the same preceding-birth technique as in previous surveys to estimate IMR and  neonatal mortality rate (NMR) per 1000 live births. All multiparous mothers who  came to the 22 UNRWA health centers to register their last-born child for  immunization were asked if their preceding child was alive or dead. We based our  target sample size on the previous IMR of 22.4 and we interviewed 3126 mothers  from September to November 2015. FINDINGS: The third survey estimated mortality  rates in 2013. The IMR was 22.7 (95% CI 17.2-28.1) per 1000 live births. IMR did  not decline since the estimated IMR of 20.2 (15.3-25.1) per 1000 live births in  2006 and 22.4 (16.4-28.3) per 1000 live births in 2011. NMR was 16.1 (11.6-20.7)  per 1000 live births, which was not statistically significantly different from  2006 (12.1 (8.7-16.4)), and was lower than in 2011 (20.3 (15.3-26.2)).

Risk factors such as mental disorders, low  socio-economic status, and stressful life events all contribute to making  refugees a high-risk group. For this reason, this meta-analysis aims to  investigate the prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts among refugees in  non-clinical populations. METHOD: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, PubPsych,  and PsycInfo for articles reporting (period) prevalence rates of suicidal  ideation and attempts. Inclusion criteria were the population of refugees or  asylum seekers (aged 16 years and older), assessment of the prevalence of  suicidal ideation and attempts in empirical studies in cross-sectional or  longitudinal settings, written in English, and published by August 2020.  Exclusion criteria were defined as a population of immigrants who have lived in  the host country for a long time, studies that examined children and adolescents  younger than 16 years, and research in clinical samples. Overall prevalence rates  were calculated using Rstudio. RESULTS: Of 294 matches, 11 publications met the  inclusion criteria. The overall period prevalence of suicidal ideation was 20.5%  (CI: 0.11-0.32, I(2) = 98%, n = 8), 22.3% (CI: 0.10-0.38, I(2) = 97%, n = 5) for  women, and 27.7% for men (CI: 0.14-0.45, I(2) = 93%, n = 3). Suicide attempts had  an overall prevalence of 0.57% (CI: 0.00-0.02, I(2) = 81%, n = 4). CONCLUSION:  There is a great lack of epidemiological studies on suicidal ideation and  attempts among refugees. The high prevalence of suicidal ideation indicates the  existence of heavy psychological burden among this population. The prevalence of  suicide attempts is similar to that in non-refugee populations. Because of the  large heterogeneity between studies, the pooled prevalence estimates must be  interpreted with caution. The results underline the need for systematic and  standardized assessment and treatment of suicidal ideation and attempts.",2022-04-01,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,635,,1,22,,BMC Public Health,,,,,,,,eng,© 2022.

A  systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out to determine the pooled  prevalence of depression and the prevalence of depression across different study  populations in the country. METHODS: Papers for the review were retrieved from  PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, African Journal OnLine, and Google Scholar databases.  All included papers were observational studies regarding depression prevalence in  Uganda, published before September 2021. The Joanna Briggs Institute Checklist  for Prevalence Studies was used to evaluate the risk of bias and quality of the  included papers, and depression pooled prevalence was determined using a  random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 127 studies comprising 123,859  individuals were identified. Most studies were conducted among individuals living  with HIV (n = 43; 33.9%), and the most frequently used instrument for assessing  depression was the Depression sub-section of the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (n =  34). The pooled prevalence of depression was 30.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]:  26.7-34.1, I2 = 99.80, p<0.001). The prevalence of depression was higher during  the COVID-19 pandemic than during the pre-pandemic period (48.1% vs. 29.3%, p =  0.021). Refugees had the highest prevalence of depression (67.6%; eight studies),  followed by war victims (36.0%; 12 studies), individuals living with HIV (28.2%;  43 studies), postpartum or pregnant mothers (26.9%; seven studies), university  students (26.9%; four studies), children and adolescents (23.6%; 10 studies), and  caregivers of patients (18.5%; six studies). LIMITATION: Significantly high  levels of heterogeneity among the studies included. CONCLUSION: Almost one in  three individuals in Uganda has depression, with the refugee population being  disproportionately affected.

We evaluated the effectiveness of the Caregiver Support  Intervention (CSI), which emphasizes caregiver wellbeing together with training  in positive parenting. METHODS: We conducted a two-arm randomized controlled  trial of the CSI with Syrian refugees in Lebanon, with an intent-to-treat design,  from September 2019-December 2020. A total of 480 caregivers from 240 families  were randomized to the CSI or a waitlist control group (1:1). Retention from  baseline to endline was 93%. Data on parenting and caregiver psychological  wellbeing were collected at baseline, endline, and three-month follow-up.  Prospective trial registration: ISRCTN22321773. RESULTS: We did not find a  significant change on overall parenting skills at endline (primary outcome  endpoint) (d = .11, p = .126) or at follow-up (Cohen's d = .15, p = .054). We did  find a significant effect on overall parenting skills among participants  receiving the full intervention-the sub-sample not interrupted by (COVID-19)  (d = 0.25, p < .05). The CSI showed beneficial effects in the full sample at  endline and follow-up on harsh parenting (d = -.17, p < .05; d = .19, p < .05),  parenting knowledge (d = .63, p < .001; d = .50, p < .001), and caregiver  distress (d = -.33, p < .001; d = .23, p < .01). We found no effects on parental  warmth and responsiveness, psychosocial wellbeing, stress, or stress management.  Changes in caregiver wellbeing partially mediated the impact of the CSI on harsh  parenting, accounting for 37% of the reduction in harsh parenting. CONCLUSIONS:  The CSI reduced harsh parenting and caregiver distress, and demonstrated the  value of addressing caregiver wellbeing as a pathway to strengthening parenting  in adversity. These effects were achieved despite a pandemic-related lockdown  that impacted implementation, a severe economic crisis, and widespread social  unrest.

The aim of this  presentation is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and patient satisfaction in PID  patients receiving subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG) treatment and to share our  expe-riences. METHODS: Twenty-one patients who were followed up with the  diagnosis of PID by our Pediatric Allergy and Immunology Clinic and received  regular intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG) befo-re starting SCIG treatment  were included in the study. RESULTS: A total of 21 patients were included in the  study. 10 of the patients (47.6%) were female, 11 (52.4%) were male, and the mean  age was 8.8±4.42 years. Five of the patients were Syrian patients living in the  refugee camp. Threshold IgG levels of the patients were evaluated every 3 months.  IgG levels were significantly higher than baseline IVIG levels at weeks 3, 6, and  12 of SCIG treatment, respectively. There was no significant difference between  3(rd), 6(th) and 12(th) months of SCIG treatment. A statistically significant  decrease was observed in the frequency of infections in patients who received  SCIG treatment (p=0.003). During SCIG treatment, the total infection rate was  4.1/person/year. According to the TSQM-9 satisfaction questionnaire, the annual  hospitalization rate was 0.9/patient/year for IVIG and 0.4/patient/year for SCIG  (p>0.005), and 61.9% of patients were moderately satisfied, 14.2%. 19% were very  satisfied and 4.7% were not satisfied with the treatment. When the satisfaction  criteria were evaluated, it was observed that the patients mostly (71%) were  satisfied with the absence of vascular access prob-lems and the comfort of  self-application at home.

This study examines how personal, interpersonal,  displacement and war-related factors have impacted married refugees' intimate  lives. METHODS: Data included 158 married Syrian refugee individuals who live in  the host communities of Jordan. Refugees reported on their personal,  interpersonal, current-displacement and past-war related experiences. Traumatic  impacts were assessed using the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ), K6 screening  scale for serious mental illness (SMI), The War Events Questionnaire (WEQ), and  Personal Assessment of Intimacy in Relationships (PAIR). Stepwise multiple  regressions were used to determine the factors associated with refugees'  intimacy-total score and its six dimensions. RESULTS: Most refugees (94.2%)  experienced war events, and 34% screened positive on the PTSD-HTQ scale. Overall  intimacy scores were low, scoring M (±standard deviation) = 2.4 (±1.1) of a  possible five on average. Intimacy scores were lower for refugees who screened  positive on the PTSD-HTQ (M = 1.95 ± 65) compared to the ones screening negative,  respectively (M = 2.23 ± 66). Furthermore, the higher the PTSD symptoms reported,  the lower the couples' intimacy. PTSD and forced marriage were the strongest  factors to predict decreased total-intimacy scores (β = -0.23, P = 0.002;  β = -0.32, P < 0.001), and decreased scores on four dimensions of intimacy  (emotional, sexual, intellectual and recreational). Whereas gender was the second  strongest factor associated with decreased total-intimacy scores (β = -0.29,  P < 0.001), and decreased scores on three dimensions of intimacy (emotional,  social and anger), meaning that women reported suffering more than men from  deteriorated intimacy in their marital relationships. Other displacement and  war-related factors associated with intimacy were: decreased sexual intimacy  associated with having been raped; increased intellectual intimacy associated  with escaped from Syria with one's spouse; decreased recreational intimacy  associated with the number of family members lived with; decreased sexual,  emotional and total-intimacy scores associated with number of children; and years  of education as a seemingly personal protective factor associated with increased  intellectual and recreational intimacy. CONCLUSIONS: Addressing Syrian refugees'  intimacy issues in interventions is essential, as well as raising the awareness  of stakeholders and community leaders to the negative impacts of PTSD, forced  marriage, rape, and displacement difficulties endured by the already challenged  and distressed married refugees.",Dec-19,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,20407,,2,9,,J Glob Health,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: Scotland PMID: 31360447  PMCID: PMC6642814,,,,Humans; Adult; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Syria/ethnology; Jordan; Refugees/*psychology/statistics & numerical data; *Interpersonal Relations; Warfare/*psychology; Spouses/*psychology/statistics & numerical data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assessed the prevalence and correlates of HIV acquisition via forced  sex among women living with HIV (WLWH) in Canada. Baseline questionnaire data  were analyzed for WLWH (≥16 years) with data on self-reported mode of HIV  acquisition, enrolled in a community-based cohort study in British Columbia,  Ontario, and Québec. We assessed forced sex (childhood, adulthood) as a  self-reported mode of HIV acquisition. Of 1,330 participants, the median age was  42 (interquartile range [IQR] = 35-50) years; 23.5% were Indigenous, 26.3%  African/Caribbean/Black, 43% White, and 7.2% of Other ethnicities.

This study presents health problems and utilization of  health services among Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals (FDMNs) living in the  southern part of Bangladesh. METHODS: A mixed-method (quantitative and  qualitative) approach was used. Altogether 999 household surveys were conducted  among the FDMNs living in makeshift/temporary settlements and host communities.  We used a grounded theory approach involving in-depth interviews (IDIs), focus  group discussions (FGDs), and key informant interviews (KIIs) including 24 IDIs,  10 FGDs, and 9 KIIs. The quantitative data were analysed with STATA. RESULTS: The  common health problems among the women were pregnancy and childbirth-related  complications and violence against women. Among the children, fever, diarrhoea,  common cold and malaria were frequently observed health problems. Poor general  health, HIV/AIDS, insecurity, discrimination, and lack of employment opportunity  were common problems for men. Further, 61.2% women received two or more antenatal  care (ANC) visits during their last pregnancy, while 28.9% did not receive any  ANC visit. The majority of the last births took place at home (85.2%) assisted by  traditional birth attendants (78.9%), a third (29.3%) of whom suffered pregnancy-  and childbirth-related complications. The clinics run by the non-governmental  organizations (NGOs) (76.9%) and private health facilities (86.0%) were the most  accessible places for seeking healthcare for the FDMNs living in the makeshift  settlements. All participants heard about HIV/AIDS. 78.0% of them were unaware  about the means of HIV transmission, and family planning methods were poorly used  (45.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the health of FDMNs living in the southern part of  Bangladesh is poor and they have inadequate access to and utilization of health  services to address the health problems and associated factors. Existing  essential health and nutrition support programs need to be culturally appropriate  and adopt an integrated approach to encourage men's participation to improve  utilization of health and family planning services, address issues of gender  inequity, gender-based violence, and improve women empowerment and overall health  outcomes.",2021-10-11,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,39,,1,6,,Glob Health Res Policy,,,,,,,,eng,© 2021.

Longitudinal studies  investigating factors associated with PTSD course are essential to enable  adequate treatment yet widely lacking. OBJECTIVE: To identify longitudinal  changes in PTSD severity and posttraumatic coping among severely traumatized  female refugees as well as risk and protective factors for PTSD course. DESIGN,  SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective cohort study took place in 14 German  cities in the context of a humanitarian admission program that resettled 1000  especially vulnerable women and children from northern Iraq to Germany.  Approximately 400 adult beneficiaries of the humanitarian admission program were  eligible for the study. At baseline, a total of 116 of the 400 beneficiaries  (29.0%) participated, with 96 (82.8%) of these women participating in the  follow-up assessment. The study included a baseline assessment conducted 2 years  after resettlement (September 1, 2017, to January 12, 2018) and a 1-year  follow-up (August 29, 2018, to January 15, 2019). EXPOSURES: Violence and/or  captivity during the 2014 genocide in northern Iraq by the so-called Islamic  State. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Posttraumatic stress disorder severity and  coping strategies were assessed in interpreter-aided interviews using the Impact  of Event Scale-Revised. RESULTS: A total of 116 women (mean [SD] age, 32.2 [8.2]  years; 115 [99.1%] Yazidi; 1 [0.9%] Christian) participated at baseline.  According to the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, a high PTSD severity was found  (mean [SD] raw sum score, 60.88 [15.75] of 88, with higher scores indicating  greater distress), with no significant change over time. Helpful coping  strategies included prayer, belief in collective strength, and belief in personal  strength. Earlier symptoms of intrusions (β = 0.389, P = .007) and longer  captivity (β = 0.218, P = .02) were identified as being associated with PTSD  severity 1 year later. Longer captivity was associated with PTSD aggravation over  time (β = 0.227, P = .04). Posttraumatic strengthening in faith (β = -0.206,  P = .05) and in social relationships (β = -0.221, P = .03) were associated with a  reduction in PTSD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest  that female refugee survivors of genocide are at high risk for severe and chronic  PTSD beyond the initial years of resettlement.

There is a need for scalable programs that can improve the mental health  of young adolescents. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a nonspecialist  delivered group-based intervention (Early Adolescent Skills for Emotions (EASE))  to improve young adolescents' mental health. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this  single-blind, parallel, controlled trial, Syrian refugees aged 10 to 14 years in  Jordan were identified through screening of psychological distress as defined by  scores ≥15 on the Paediatric Symptom Scale. Participants were randomised to  either EASE or enhanced usual care (EUC) involving referral to local psychosocial  services (on a 1:1.6 ratio). Participants were aware of treatment allocation but  assessors were blinded. Primary outcomes were scores on the Paediatric Symptom  Checklist (PSC; internalising, externalising, and attentional difficulty scales)  assessed at week 0, 9 weeks, and 3 months after treatment (primary outcome time  point). It was hypothesised that EASE would result in greater reductions on  internalising symptoms than EUC. Secondary outcomes were depression,  posttraumatic stress, well-being, functioning, school belongingness, and  caregivers' parenting and mental health. Between June 2019 and January 2020,  1,842 young adolescent refugees were screened for eligibility on the basis of  psychological distress. There were 520 adolescents (28.2%) who screened positive,  of whom 471 (90.6%) agreed to enter the trial. Overall, 185 were assigned to EASE  and 286 to EUC, and 169 and 254 were retained at 3 months for EASE and EUC,  respectively. Intent-to-treat analyses indicated that at 3 months, EASE resulted  in greater reduction on the PSC-internalising scale than EUC (estimated mean  difference 0.69, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.19; p = 0.007; effect size, 0.38) but there  were no differences for PSC-externalising (estimated mean difference 0.24, 95% CI  -0.43 to 0.91; p = 0.49; effect size, -0.10), PSC-attentional problem (estimated  mean difference -0.01, 95% CI -0.51 to 0.54; p = 0.97; effect size, -0.01)  scores, or on depression, posttraumatic stress, well-being, functioning, or  school belongingness. Relative to EUC, caregivers in EASE had less psychological  distress (estimated mean difference 1.95, 95% CI 0.71 to 3.19; p = 0.002) and  inconsistent disciplinary parenting (mean difference 1.54, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.05; p  < 0.001). Secondary analyses that (a) focused on adolescents with probable  internalising disorders; (b) completed the 3-month assessment; and (c) controlled  for trauma exposure did not alter the primary results. Mediation analysis  indicated that for caregivers in the EASE condition, reduction in inconsistent  disciplinary parenting was associated with reduced attentional (β = 0.11, SE  0.07; 95% CI 0.003, 0.274) and internalising (β = 0.11, SE 0.07; 95% CI 0.003,  0.274) problems in their children. No adverse events were attributable to the  intervention. A limitation was that EUC was not matched to EASE in terms of  facilitator attention or group involvement. CONCLUSIONS: EASE led to reduced  internalising problems in young refugee adolescents and was associated with  reduced distress and less inconsistent disciplinary parenting in caregivers. This  intervention has the potential as a scalable intervention to mitigate young  adolescents' emotional difficulties in LMIC.

Surveillance summaries (Washington, D.C. : 2002)",,1545-8636 1546-0738,10.15585/mmwr.ss7102a1,,"PROBLEM/CONDITION: Each year, approximately 500,000 immigrants and tens of thousands of refugees (range: 12,000-85,000 during 2001-2020) move to the United  States. While still abroad, immigrants, refugees, and others who apply for  admission to live permanently in the United States must undergo a medical  examination. This examination identifies persons with class A or B conditions.  Applicants with class A conditions are inadmissible. Infectious conditions that  cause an applicant to be inadmissible include infectious tuberculosis (TB)  disease (class A TB), infectious syphilis, gonorrhea, and infectious Hansen's  disease. Applicants with class B conditions are admissible but might require  treatment or follow-up. Class B TB includes persons who completed successful  treatment overseas for TB disease (class B0), those with signs or symptoms  suggestive of TB but whose overseas laboratory tests and clinical examinations  ruled out current infectious TB disease (class B1), those with a diagnosis of  latent TB infection (LTBI) (class B2), and the close contacts of persons known to  have TB disease (class B3). Voluntary public health interventions might also be  offered during the overseas examination. After arriving in the United States, a  follow-up TB examination is recommended for persons with class B TB. PERIOD  COVERED: This report summarizes health information that was reported to CDC's  Electronic Disease Notification (EDN) system for refugees, immigrants, and  eligible others who arrived in the United States during 2014-2019. Eligible  others are persons who although not classified as refugees (e.g., certain  parolees, special immigrant visa holders, and follow-to-join asylees) are  eligible for the same services and benefits as refugees. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM:  The EDN system has both surveillance and programmatic components. The  surveillance component is a centralized database that collects 1) health-related  data from the overseas medical examination for immigrants with class A or B  conditions and for all refugees and eligible others and 2) TB-related data from  the postarrival TB examination. The programmatic component is a reporting system  that sends arrival notifications to state and local health agencies in the  jurisdiction where newly arriving persons have reported intending to live and  provides state and local health agencies and other authorized users with medical  data from overseas examinations. RESULTS: During 2014-2019, approximately 3.5  million persons moved to the United States from abroad, including 3.2 million  immigrants, 313,890 refugees, and 95,993 eligible others. Among these, the  overseas examination identified 139,683 persons (3,903 per 100,000 persons  examined) with class B TB, 54 with primary or secondary syphilis (30 per 100,000  persons tested), 761 with latent syphilis (415 per 100,000 persons tested), and,  after laboratory testing for gonorrhea was added in 2016, a total of 131 with  gonorrhea (374 per 100,000 persons tested). Refugees were offered additional,  voluntary interventions, including vaccinations and presumptive treatment for  parasites. By 2019, first- and second-dose coverage with measles-containing  vaccine were 96% and 80%, respectively. In refugee populations for whom  presumptive treatment is recommended, up to 96% of refugees, depending on the  specific regimen, were offered and accepted treatment. For the 139,683 persons  identified overseas with class B TB, EDN sent arrival notifications and overseas  medical data to the appropriate state or local health agency to facilitate  postarrival TB examinations. Among 101,119 persons identified overseas as having  class B0 TB (6,586) or class B1 TB (94,533), a total of 67,432 (67%) had a  complete postarrival examination reported to EDN. Among 35,814 children aged 2-14  years identified overseas with class B2 TB, 20,758 (58%) had a complete  postarrival examination reported to EDN. (Adults are not routinely tested for  immune reactivity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis during the overseas medical  examination.) Among those with a complete postarrival examination reported to  EDN, the number with a diagnosis of culture-positive TB disease within the first  year of arrival was 464 (688 cases per 100,000 persons examined) for those with  class B0 or B1 TB and was 11 (53 cases per 100,000 persons examined) for children  with class B2 TB. INTERPRETATION: During 2014-2019, the overseas medical  examination system prevented importation of 6,586 cases of infectious TB, 815  cases of syphilis, and 131 cases of gonorrhea. When the examination is used to  offer public health interventions, most refugees (up to 96%) accept the  intervention. Postarrival follow-up examinations, which were completed for 88,190  persons and identified 475 cases of culture-positive TB, represent an important  opportunity to further limit spread of TB disease in the United States by  identifying and providing, if needed, preventive care for those with LTBI or  treatment for those with disease. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: Federal, state, and local  health departments and agencies should continue to use EDN data to monitor,  evaluate, and improve health-related programs and policies aimed at U.S.-bound or  recently arrived immigrants, refugees, and eligible others. Additional public  health interventions that could be offered during the overseas medical  examination should be considered (e.g., treatment for LTBI). Finally, for persons  with class B TB, measures should be taken to identify and remove barriers to  completing postarrival examinations to reduce risk for TB disease and community  transmission, along with measures to encourage reporting of completed  examinations for better data-driven decision-making.",2022-01-21,2023-02-18 18:12,2023-02-18 18:12,NA,NA,NA,NA,,21-Jan,,2,71,,MMWR Surveill Summ,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,Place: United States PMID: 35051136  PMCID: PMC8791661,,,,"Humans; Adult; United States/epidemiology; Child; Adolescent; Child, Preschool; *Emigrants and Immigrants; *Refugees; Mass Screening; *Tuberculosis, Lymph Node; Disease Notification; Electronics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, internationally available estimates of  population and fertility, although useful, have not been produced with  transparent and replicable methods and do not use standardised estimates of  mortality. We present single-calendar year and single-year of age estimates of  fertility and population by sex with standardised and replicable methods.  METHODS: We estimated population in 195 locations by single year of age and  single calendar year from 1950 to 2017 with standardised and replicable methods.  We based the estimates on the demographic balancing equation, with inputs of  fertility, mortality, population, and migration data. Fertility data came from  7817 location-years of vital registration data, 429 surveys reporting complete  birth histories, and 977 surveys and censuses reporting summary birth histories.  We estimated age-specific fertility rates (ASFRs; the annual number of livebirths  to women of a specified age group per 1000 women in that age group) by use of  spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression and used the ASFRs to estimate total  fertility rates (TFRs; the average number of children a woman would bear if she  survived through the end of the reproductive age span [age 10-54 years] and  experienced at each age a particular set of ASFRs observed in the year of  interest). Because of sparse data, fertility at ages 10-14 years and 50-54 years  was estimated from data on fertility in women aged 15-19 years and 45-49 years,  through use of linear regression. Age-specific mortality data came from the  Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017 estimates.  Data on population came from 1257 censuses and 761 population registry  location-years and were adjusted for underenumeration and age misreporting with  standard demographic methods. Migration was estimated with the GBD Bayesian  demographic balancing model, after incorporating information about refugee  migration into the model prior. Final population estimates used the  cohort-component method of population projection, with inputs of fertility,  mortality, and migration data. Population uncertainty was estimated by use of  out-of-sample predictive validity testing. With these data, we estimated the  trends in population by age and sex and in fertility by age between 1950 and 2017  in 195 countries and territories. FINDINGS: From 1950 to 2017, TFRs decreased by  49·4% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 46·4-52·0). The TFR decreased from 4·7  livebirths (4·5-4·9) to 2·4 livebirths (2·2-2·5), and the ASFR of mothers aged  10-19 years decreased from 37 livebirths (34-40) to 22 livebirths (19-24) per  1000 women. Despite reductions in the TFR, the global population has been  increasing by an average of 83·8 million people per year since 1985. The global  population increased by 197·2% (193·3-200·8) since 1950, from 2·6 billion  (2·5-2·6) to 7·6 billion (7·4-7·9) people in 2017; much of this increase was in  the proportion of the global population in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The  global annual rate of population growth increased between 1950 and 1964, when it  peaked at 2·0%; this rate then remained nearly constant until 1970 and then  decreased to 1·1% in 2017. Population growth rates in the southeast Asia, east  Asia, and Oceania GBD super-region decreased from 2·5% in 1963 to 0·7% in 2017,  whereas in sub-Saharan Africa, population growth rates were almost at the highest  reported levels ever in 2017, when they were at 2·7%. The global average age  increased from 26·6 years in 1950 to 32·1 years in 2017, and the proportion of  the population that is of working age (age 15-64 years) increased from 59·9% to  65·3%. At the national level, the TFR decreased in all countries and territories  between 1950 and 2017; in 2017, TFRs ranged from a low of 1·0 livebirths (95% UI  0·9-1·2) in Cyprus to a high of 7·1 livebirths (6·8-7·4) in Niger. The TFR under  age 25 years (TFU25; number of livebirths expected by age 25 years for a  hypothetical woman who survived the age group and was exposed to current ASFRs)  in 2017 ranged from 0·08 livebirths (0·07-0·09) in South Korea to 2·4 livebirths  (2·2-2·6) in Niger, and the TFR over age 30 years (TFO30; number of livebirths  expected for a hypothetical woman ageing from 30 to 54 years who survived the age  group and was exposed to current ASFRs) ranged from a low of 0·3 livebirths  (0·3-0·4) in Puerto Rico to a high of 3·1 livebirths (3·0-3·2) in Niger. TFO30  was higher than TFU25 in 145 countries and territories in 2017. 33 countries had  a negative population growth rate from 2010 to 2017, most of which were located  in central, eastern, and western Europe, whereas population growth rates of more  than 2·0% were seen in 33 of 46 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2017, less  than 65% of the national population was of working age in 12 of 34 high-income  countries, and less than 50% of the national population was of working age in  Mali, Chad, and Niger. INTERPRETATION: Population trends create demographic  dividends and headwinds (ie, economic benefits and detriments) that affect  national economies and determine national planning needs. Although TFRs are  decreasing, the global population continues to grow as mortality declines, with  diverse patterns at the national level and across age groups. To our knowledge,  this is the first study to provide transparent and replicable estimates of  population and fertility, which can be used to inform decision making and to  monitor progress.
