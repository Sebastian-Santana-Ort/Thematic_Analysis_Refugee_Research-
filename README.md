# Thematic Analysis of Refugee Research using R.

The purpose of this repository is to host some work I did while working at the Human Early Learning Partnership. I was tasked with performing a cursory literature review of the research (past 5 years) on the education and health outcomes of refugee children. 

I was able to perform the following:

- Sentiment analysis of the terms included in the titles of articles (i.e., frequency of positive or negative words):

- Used Markov chains to understand the relationship between bigrams:

-   Used k-Means (an unsupervised machine learning algorithm) to build thematic clusters from all entries:

In this repository, you will find the following items: (1) The original Markdown used to create these images, (2) A copy of the dataset I utilized, (3) an R project file which, when opened, will allow you to replicate my work, (4) a folder containing the images above, and (5) .md file containing more detail on all my analysis.
